You know what I do is to write for kids, and, in fact, I am probably the author for kids, and in fact, most of this <unk>
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
And I can do it as a farmer, and I can have never chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is a thing that fell into some place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of very complicated type of circle.
My circle started in the middle of the years in the middle school years, in the middle school where I was the class.
When I was ready to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when he got to go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and <unk> dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four or four years ago, I got a telephone phone call to that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio, and please get that man that I know you've ever seen.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> and I would like you with <unk> and I would love you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to it, we were <unk> and we realized she needed to be <unk>
We found one place, the <unk> and we found it out of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box in the ashes and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had had turned into a circle -- it had become a circle -- that one I told you that I talked to you in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and we save the back of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of your life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy and I'm very happy today today.
It also needs to -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quick, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
They <unk> my <unk> about 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that was to think that it was a <unk> about snow in another <unk> year in the <unk> year in a year <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or break down the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has their individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give it up to the end, while others can't get them to the end, while others can't get it more and <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and isolated and themselves, as we look at it as a human <unk>
But the reality is the opposite.
And as a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing in their ancestral atmosphere.
And as an iceberg melts as an eardrum it releases fresh water that feeds so many different forms of life.
I come to me to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of their life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> the <unk> that photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over a thousand years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you are from an eardrum that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a bit frequent to actually witness a fiscal eardrum it really <unk>
Here they are.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the eardrum and your <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing up.
So this is an eardrum that is <unk>
They drop out of the water about 120 feet or 20 feet.
This video is real time.
And so the iceberg the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby.
So, two couples in a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about it, you won't pay me attention.
Think about it for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins into the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X <unk>
They both <unk> and <unk>
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground activity I turned to two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people started to come up with the anatomy -- that means of human bodies -- to say, from human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about your body.
The other role that the other role in my work is an activist, the <unk> of patients -- or as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working working for example, with twins two people within a single body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with sex with <unk> individuals whose physical <unk> not fit in male schemes and male <unk>
In general lines, we can see <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't happen in the common forms in common or <unk>
For example, this case is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which tells the chromosome from the chromosome -- we all have in life -- that we all have in the life that we all have in the life <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops in the course of a <unk> course.
When you <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a girl, it's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not up to puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual vaccine, when somebody realizes that something is happening.
After making it tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have the body -- something called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produces <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I -- I think, is a <unk> woman doesn't know their <unk> structure, and I believe a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> syndrome that has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way.
Another example: a few years ago, a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> had no life as a boy and had just to discover that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes -- and in the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were exposed to the brain was exposed to the hormonal component of the male -- a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to the years when he started to have a medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was women inside.
Well, another example of a <unk>
Some people with 20th 20th developed they have to be known as <unk> which is to say, they have <unk> tissue, wrapped in tissue.
We don't know how to do that.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with this type of bodies -- they are <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> surgery -- is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have an <unk> identity is to be black to be black wants to say to have African anatomy in the historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you have a body of a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very important ideas in our culture in the <unk>
Our nation is based on the concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have kids that are born like two people within a body.
The greatest case last year is last year with the <unk> South African African <unk> put in web trial his sex <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What do a test will do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> it's man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is not a <unk> between men and women or <unk> and <unk> we are who <unk> that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these <unk> categories were more likely to thought -- were a stable categories, that are a lot more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go on a very rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact we share about 95 percent of the DNA with the chimpanzees.
What do they <unk> the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in science -- we get more and more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we need to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights.
There are very <unk> discussions today in <unk> not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to stand up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him got a pen in front of your nose, and if you moved it to still don't <unk>
If I stopped moving it off.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put it into another body.
And, as a result, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma that is actually being puts in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me.
In politics in politics I'm <unk> I'm saving people with unusual bodies.
We think these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find that in so much watching that musical <unk> I find myself and not by the music, which is completely <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another which it was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everyone remember, what was our <unk> our <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was going to the political power of the blood right of the mother's right of the grandfather and then the father and then the son, and so on.
<unk> <unk> rejected by that idea and replacing it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy that mattered to a common and not the <unk> <unk> -- that was something very radical.
And partly what they were doing because they're part of a <unk> system that were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> it is from a vague idea of the right of the birth of the birth of the <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk>
And if we look for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are. We are.
And as a result, they were spreading the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement movement.
They didn't think about that way, they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the Civil Rights Movement of Civil Rights <unk>
And again, people from color to the <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the commodities, we have to start asking for why we keep doing certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't mean that we need <unk> to anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense that I think that I should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are, why do it make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was three months before time: June 1 in June of June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, in the contrary, that was born on March June 1 was born.
By the fact that we have been born three months before Mary was going to the world's three months before Henry <unk> the right of the <unk> the right of the <unk> the right to the vote, to the vote, the right to the <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because of a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered -- it's the <unk> of the king that Mary doesn't have to worry about it <unk>
Mary. For the part, it doesn't have the same rights as a marriage rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So they still are <unk> categories that in various aspects of <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we do now that science is going to be put in the anatomy of the anatomy that we get to the point to have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time I feel like science, I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of a kind of <unk> attitude that you say, "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are caught in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain time he has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to get married to a woman has to have the <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story I told the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
If we look at the founders of modern <unk> of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I have to <unk> it offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people judge people not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm sure that we should be involved in the rights of people, because I would admit that I know that I know some <unk> that probably deserve more social services than a few humans I know.
I also want to tell you that maybe some <unk> that I know that you can make more intelligent and clever decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 to the ones I know.
So how do we put the subject of the <unk> content.
It's very hard.
And one part of me the question what would happen if the character of a person could be measured in the future is measured with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States of the United States is going to continue this current of thinking of the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context like the Iranian man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to <unk> -- unless it's willing to engage a change of sex, in which case is it allows to be a living.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon with the surgeon that I talked about a few years ago that I had done to <unk> twins and then they were able to pick up the <unk>
But when the phone came to the phone of the operation, <unk> a very <unk> operation, told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it has considered political <unk> rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge opportunities for people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, at the end I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how to be democracy, or as it might be been, if we given more involvement to the <unk>
And I mean a little radical little bit radical for a <unk> and it is that I believe that there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking groups.
For years years since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching sexual difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in the differences between men and women in the way to think and to operate in the world.
And what we know about the <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care of those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at college, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in <unk> I was considered to me as a <unk> he made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do to get rid of the gender stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I have thought of something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, on average, something different between the feminine brain between the feminine brain relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if <unk> were very attentive to finding the way to protect the people in the state of the state, we may be able to more <unk> to this concept.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when you get the democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in your individual body, in terms of identity, in terms of identity, to think more in the relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where to be going to live and work and work to have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count in a single city willing to be <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth more than its building cost.
So we could easily get to the world <unk> maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound really absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But it simply would be <unk> by buildings.
Imagine that half of the ones you want to live in apartments already -- they were the owners and the other half still to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make it <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have standards to avoid the <unk> and the distractions for construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, build a building building completely new, always and when the rules of that place <unk> the construction instead of getting <unk>
And so I proposed that the governments of these new reform zones are big enough to contain cities, and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found that I found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come out of their country to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> by a constitutional crisis, <unk> by a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to speak for a TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under the <unk>
The first point was the importance of norms, as those rules that say you can't go and go to all the current residents in the apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies as well as to <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala friend sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a meeting in Miami, a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about this point about valuable and more valuable cities, much more valuable cities, your cost.
And I used this image that shows the land of the land in a place like New York -- <unk> land that, in some cases, that's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in a very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that <unk> and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or don't live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk again about four and five to five of January.
So I presented another picture of data, full of data, which included in an image like this, which was about explaining to that for a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport to <unk>
Just this airport is covers over 100 miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, we have to start with a site that is going to be just about one <unk> square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came to the platform, and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much because of your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can provide new choices for the people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North Carolina.
And they also bring new choices to leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries may be able to benefit and make the rules of <unk> so that they all could be able to trust the <unk> so that they could all trust that they can trust that <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional <unk> that allowed to create these special regions of the development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this Chinese <unk> was <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February passed over again and on the top of the <unk> they passed over again.
After the voting after the voting at the July at 24 in February, a delegation of 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center that is building in North Korea is much larger than the Boston of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years after they spent four years by getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they are already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and they would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the last court for this new justice system.
There are <unk> and <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've solved is that you have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be in <unk> especially in a place with a place zone, and there are a lot of people who want to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would just be changed to another place.
There's a million a year per year in Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family to get a work, sometimes are mothers who have to make money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet their parents that haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or will we build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
My <unk> friends asked me to say to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what you're inside, I'm going to make a public <unk> and I live with <unk> <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, I love to find and post and post in my blog and <unk> and so different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is <unk> <unk> <unk> markets, and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second <unk> stores that allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people by <unk> and usually my money on a good <unk> My <unk> <unk> and buying it into my personal quest for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
That's my size?
I would like color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, I feel like I've won.
To go back to my theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings it to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought them seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week for a week is all that I've put in my <unk>
I thought I thought I'd be able to find everything else that I would use to use it to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in internal clothing.  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you right now for this week.
It doesn't sound <unk>
While I do, I'm also going to tell you a few of the lessons of life -- that <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is the brilliant tiger tiger to this.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> I had <unk> it was the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> being <unk> when you're wearing a red pants pants on the bright red pants up.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a long time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get out of the right people right now, not just <unk> you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child in the <unk>
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to me that play <unk> or I remind them to their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk> <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and your outside, there's no look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style -- and it's a great way to tell the world to the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested again and again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I will give you all to the <unk>
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there always will be another suit -- <unk> and bright and bright and <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and I went on.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up two parts.
The left side, the left side, which is the logic -- and the right side that's the intuitive.
So if you have a scale scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for your brain.
For example, it would be somebody completely logical.
This would be somebody totally intuitive.
So, where does your brain look at this scale?
Some of them <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not being mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, as well as most Western quantum physicists, we need pretty much logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to doing the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see the same thing, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that they may have developed with the passage of the years, which says one thing can be done at a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a <unk> a <unk> in a parking bar.
It was a small boy and didn't do very well, they were always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in that parking lot taught a valuable lesson, and is that big things don't allow them to <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you be a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physics, because they don't play with bars, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles they find that they do all sorts of things weird things, like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point, I was the physics of the physics of the years -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe not very often because of the often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not much.
And I've never seen.
I mean, nobody ever saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my <unk>
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles in the beginning of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't do everything in the early mechanics of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it should be not.
And so I felt much better would feel much better if I could think that a common object is still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it has been in an overlap on quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little metal thing I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom here a little bit on the center.
And then here we do a very big approach, of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal and a springboard and <unk> and <unk> on a platform.
And then I made this sort of a computer chip you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip chip chip and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole in a swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it it needs to be a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator I do all sorts of things, but then when other people go up with me to stop doing those things, because I don't want them, or really, actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The teammates on the journey of the inanimate objects are not just people, is the light that passes it, and the wind that passes on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal little bit to behave in quantum mechanics, we would have to throw it out of quantum mechanics, we would have to throw it out to the <unk>
And that's what we did.
You get the lights then -- then you get a <unk> and pulled it all the air, and then you put it to a temperature of a temperature at the absolute <unk>
Now, being only in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it was moving in very odd ways.
Instead of staying in staying perfectly still, and the way that <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands -- which expands and <unk>
And when you give it a <unk> <unk> we could make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal and at the same time those same atoms are still moving and at the same time that atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It wants to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was a <unk> on a fresh room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, because watch a scale at the scale of one atom and that little metal is more or less the same thing as a difference between that little little metal thing.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how would that be?
How do your awareness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it turns out, and we turned on the lights and we looked into the lights and we looked into the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot of a lot of quantum mechanics about quantum mechanics -- it says it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
That's more profound.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that he allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and 18 months to me.
A lot of and a lot of stories and <unk> with 17 very interesting museums are <unk>
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide here, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible to technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you a demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from your launch.
So we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the blueprint on the top, and with a single click, and we jumped in.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
continue forward. It was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get in 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get over 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is <unk>
But if you really want it to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A minute, this seems <unk>
I went and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people of the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hit a Tuesday a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper in and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to go to the image, so you can really see what you are.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what Van Gogh is actually created <unk>
It goes up, and really it goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'll show you another of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can go online to create your own museum, create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple -- we created this function that I call <unk> the power of <unk> -- we just just <unk> around.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I believe that for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble humble thing.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means to do that in this digital medium to the work of art, which is represented online.
And the great question I do today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's the experience.
And that's it. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a flying pixel is a <unk>
In our lab we call sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, Italian from all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason why I show them this is that it has something very interesting to <unk> <unk> one in the last two decades.
I took some time, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, I took a budget and you put it to a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you get a career.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a sensor and a <unk>
So today what's interesting that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics and electronics and electronics have been covered in networks in the last few years.
They're becoming <unk> computers.
And as a <unk> they're starting to respond different and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you tell aside I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> consumption -- and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is an exhibition <unk> <unk> <unk> for the late end of the summer during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way it's like almost all the atoms in the existing atoms and the <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old <unk> dream.
You know, when Miguel <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and threw it into the Moses -- actually you can actually see a little <unk> a <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer time in 2006.
It was the year that Italy had the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they were -- they were in and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
On the late afternoon, there are people around here and <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a phone call and he's the bathroom.
Second time. End of time. End of time.
First <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, <unk>
She earns Italy, <unk>
That night everyone went to the center.
There you see the <unk>
The next day everyone went to the middle of the team and the first minister of the first minister at the point.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> is a great party, you can see the summit peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city of the city so we couldn't do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but about things that we use and we consume.
Today, we know all about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make make you meet.
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its shift in its system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle to a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
You go from <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're really complicated things, and there is a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if we see the day that the cup that we <unk> no longer disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
So if the plastic bottle I <unk> you one day still follow there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question from the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, the technology is to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop -- was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tubes.
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels are <unk> you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And by the <unk> the curtain will open to that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the input of the <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
All the building is made in water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you come up to it is open to that you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> your roof.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture is gone, like this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not <unk> but when you go down almost all the architecture of the architecture that's gone.
Here it is working.
You see the people <unk> what happens inside.
And here I'm right now, trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped the working.
That night it was really more fun.
All the children from <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed.
It wasn't a building that it would open to leave you to let me go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in the water and you had to jump down and jump up to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels of the physical pixels of water and water pixels and projections on them.
And this is what led to the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air that each one had a small pixel in the color of color as if it was a cloud that moves into space.
This is the video.
So you can imagine a helicopter, like we saw before, that is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, what could we form like this cloud,
A flexible screen like this is a flexible configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in a 3D <unk> you can reach, and you can see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to it to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights you turn into the light, you see this.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, and so forth, and so forth and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the top dancers of the New York City -- the star <unk> and <unk> to capture their movements into 3D and use them as a <unk> for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the whole way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, you could engage the people to do something and change our <unk> environment and change our <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
So today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go through the digital world, we can move the digital world, of the digital <unk>
In our case, this may we want use to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or the CO2 emissions or the CO2 emissions.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered by <unk>
You can be moving inside, having different experiences.
You can see at the bottom, I will be able to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something as something you can go up, like a new top <unk>
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important experience is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I said that with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve it by a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better way, it will be stronger to have a stronger resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of ourselves?
What about more with good health?
Or maybe those people who want to be more creative. Or be more creative.
What else is it that more <unk>
What do you want you to, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people would I choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably owe to the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many of the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of them -- that makes me feel very well as a medical doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject, here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> that in addition to the Catholic Church in the Catholic Church was written by a trial in biology has a sense in biology, has sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution of biological evolution, consider this: it's only the past, or the future?
It's about the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree in life.
The human part of this branch, well at a end, it is, of course, the most interested.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or eight million years ago or eight or
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 or 25 species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here <unk> years old.
It may seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but in fact, most of the basic basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin bacteria that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like insulin genes, but it's the same protein, <unk> from the pancreatic -- which is the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the most gut gut that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times the more.
I mean, think -- you know, when Antonio <unk> you get it from the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderful environment for those bacteria. bacteria.
It's warm <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that can you want no effort to communicate it part.
It's really like a fast way for the bacteria with occasional disruption in the occasional performing <unk>
But so forth, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients to <unk> nutrients and protect us out of certain diseases.
But what do the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance of evolutionary balance.
Or it meant to become something different, something that perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony, <unk> the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and only <unk> and human life, a little note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope that you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in the most of the existence of life, in the temperate organisms, and all the genetic energy we divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two cells.
But when the organisms appear to <unk> things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction -- the rest of the body reproduction -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that <unk> of the death of the body is coming into evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it looked pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, and he had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still in Las Vegas well in their late years.
And one night somebody hits his door to your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it is a gorgeous <unk> of clothes.
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk>
"He's doing George "I pick the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal of <unk> to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to regain the health in the disease.
I wanted it to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us go to the sea.
I think we all get the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want you to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily hurt the biggest or a faster or faster and even the smartest or even the most smart.
Evolution carries the creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean <unk> that you can survive on the heat of the <unk> that you might find if there were fish there, organic <unk> <unk> in the empty, but they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that they don't <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that by medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to get to us, as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> so that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that you have an evolution of the traditional way, the radical type, dictated by nature.
And the argument here is, the gears here would be the gears of evolution roll slowly, but it's <unk>
And as soon as it happens, as a species of distant planets are going to exist, you are going to have the isolation and the environmental changes and the environmental changes.
But there is a third possibility, an innocent intriguing possibility.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the way that are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
So how could we do that?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but that's what you choose to the individual and the <unk>
Think that if it is also possible to be able to choose not only sex from its <unk> but in your own body to make the <unk> <unk> to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or to reduce the risk of cancer or to remove the <unk>
They wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, and the Human Genome Project.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year I had done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three dollars in three months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs from the human genome to a cost of 20,000 and in the cost of 20,000 and in a little week.
Not a lot to be a lot to make a human genome to actually make it more and more and more in the scope of all.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin insulin is able to make viruses not only are going to protect us from the same but are going to host herd against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine in the field against <unk> <unk> in cells of a <unk>
Can you imagine a good thing about the <unk>
That's actually today, and in the future is now going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and giving your kids a better chance to get the diabetes, remove the diabetes, reduce the <unk>
Who doesn't want you to younger children.
And then, that same <unk> technology that same motor of the science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to also allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Ken on everything if you could get it to the next generation of the <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't I live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of going pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have the evolution we wanted to have the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally I could take 100 thousand years and we can take it for 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices into a better society, more successful.
Or are we going to be selectively selectively different attributes we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more robust and more robust and more robust and more robust and more robust life.
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom you need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk with <unk> <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot already had <unk> and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened to the same time.
And the pilot pilot to the Hudson River.
It's usually <unk>
We were <unk> the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words <unk> the most <unk> words you have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more to the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get to and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to do all the experiences that I wanted to have never been <unk>
As I thought about that, I came up with a sentence, a <unk> which is, <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do nothing in life.
And that's the fact that the purpose, really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the George Washington, which was so much -- I thought about a lot of <unk> <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave me to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time to put in things that didn't matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken up in 20 pieces like you see that <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, it doesn't die fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want me to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness as a single thought, in a single thought, which is, I want you one thing.
I wish I could see my kids to grow.
One month later, I was in my daughter -- first grade, not very much artistic talent -- <unk> --  And I scream, <unk> like a small little <unk>
And for me, that was the whole reason for me, this was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I realized to connect those two points, that the only two points in my life is to be a great parent.
And above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I gave me a miracle, a miracle, not to die that day.
And then I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and live in another and live way.
You are flying in today, the challenge you can imagine that you are going to be on your airplane -- and please do not be that -- but you know, and how do you <unk>
What is it that they <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and energy into them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in the lives with a lot of projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came home after he went home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, we have a total paralysis of it.
You can only use your eyes.
His job he influenced me.
I have a design company, and I have an animation company and an animation design that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to be <unk> to <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk about Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it -- I just want to be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, isn't that <unk> you see Stephen <unk> is not that all the people with paralysis can be to communicate with those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and you have a very good insurance you can't really do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Would anybody see film, "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate with that way, they are making them with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced me to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed check that didn't have the slightest idea of how it was going to be.
I was <unk> with his brother and her father there at that very moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony Tony -- we're going to build a machine, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back to work again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who is so much in their inner can't be able to <unk>
So I talked to a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys that called <unk> <unk> <unk> Research that you have a technology that allows you to project you will project light on any surface and then a laser, you draw on the negative space.
So they go out and making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life.
First starts with the sex organs, then with the bad words after the <unk> attacks, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, and so much to move the things on one side to another side of which we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we get a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Not <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world in the world -- all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I went to the garage, and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> they took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken the frames off the walls and their place there were <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son is part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of <unk> <unk> that we buy in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire wire and things from <unk>
We take a <unk> camera <unk> we put it on a light of LED LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- we build the source code, and the software is low in a way for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that say "No."
There are no hospital that can be said.
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more than a planning, two weeks of planning, two weeks from all night, Tony <unk> for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I would push the bed to it.
And we put a projector on a wall outside of the outside of the hospital.
And he turned to <unk> for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine what the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take us on the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti too.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said to us, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like it had been under water and somebody finally came to the <unk> and they would get me out there so that it could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in the movement for developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of an <unk>
Somebody with this an artistic potential it deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
We've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December Time magazine recognized as one of the 50 <unk> of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what you end up to closing the <unk> is that in April April <unk> in April <unk> in the Los Angeles center, in the middle of Los Angeles going to be an exhibition called <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of the urban art <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show that it's pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, you could make it possible.
None of the stuff in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I did anything with <unk> recognition technology, just I recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want everyone to do every day when we find something that we feel what I feel like to do. If I'm not now, <unk> And if I am not -- who am I who <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the past years last years in very very difficult situations at the same time.
I went to the <unk>
I worked in a <unk> <unk>
<unk> in areas of the <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this very difficult thing in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, in fact, a lot of my career I've been involved in situations in the appearance of horrible and the only goal of treat. I have been able to examine social issues of ways that <unk> attractive, and hopefully analyzing in a way that look cool and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk over the world of the brands I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> in <unk>
I sent some of the messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk TEDTalk in 2011.
What was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as the content could be done in your face, especially in your face, and your company to do it.
But this is a very good one, it's a <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't have done with certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done so hard for something so dangerous or as dangerous as entering rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try and <unk> the product and the <unk> and that all the film were <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and <unk>
The film is going to be called <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The greatest <unk> I ever <unk> is that all above the top at the bottom, it has images of brand, you can see it all over the way back to the title, <unk> <unk> which appears before the title -- the X-ray brand there.
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk>
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> it just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> for <unk>
But not only are we going to have the <unk> of the brand in the title but we're going to make sure -- all the categories that we can do in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe that you have <unk>
The most cool car that you've ever driven in "The greatest <unk> you have ever <unk> the best drink from <unk> from <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as a life of life, making it -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot at beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive people going to be to that.
<unk> You've got a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> but you know how it's going to be <unk> <unk> not <unk> -- how much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a <unk> -- John <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard to the meeting of them, but it's certainly going to be a <unk> to convince a couple of big seeds.
<unk> <unk> you know, maybe for the moment when the movie comes to us look like a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> most of the answers are going to be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I got <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about the <unk>
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> when you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought I was <unk> it meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know nothing about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all companies suddenly disappeared.
None of him want to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And so I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, as possible, as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage <unk> is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is worthy of attention to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake, and that error was this one.
It didn't really blame that mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was that this image.
See, when you look for images from <unk> in Google <unk>    This is one of the first images that came out.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No. No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> that is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to it is actually something that really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  -- like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to tell you <unk> history.
We want it to make a story, but we want to tell you, <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was a lie -- and my father in a lie -- and there is staring at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, I want to help me -- and just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my mind, I would have to take out to line and go to the <unk> and go to companies with my whole team.
So what I started to figure out and suddenly -- which I started to give me me is that when you start talking to companies, the idea of understanding your mark is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make films that make big, enormous, giant ones, and other people that make small independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make movies of Hollywood big, giant Hollywood says that the reason their movies are both successful because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make films that independent say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to get out and every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk>
At any time during an interview I can say "Are you very cool <unk> for this <unk>
You're <unk> you see a little nervous.
I want you to help you make it up.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of the <unk> they're going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, <unk> <unk>
That's a look at it.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look <unk>
By Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kinds of movies more small than <unk> we are pretty much a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that other <unk>
So do things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason why this interest us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> it's white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you want to describe the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep it cool out more time? With better than <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What is a famous kind of common guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, the people like me -- to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: revive 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess that kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing legs, I'm wearing toilet <unk> or the <unk> <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I would call it <unk> <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: partly <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: There was a failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of this is a brand being made Tom, but I often stand up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me to understand what they call <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and they start in a place and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next is that it was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and you will be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things like weird things.
A: <unk> of the <unk> so what do you do that?
What's the <unk> What is <unk> you are right now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
Some more of you who are not you are.
What other <unk> you've got <unk>
You don't have to be afraid of what type of rollercoaster you?
MS: Wow. <unk> Thank you.) <unk> Thank you.
AT: Thank you for your <unk> <unk> Big <unk> AT: Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness to do this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides there -- but <unk> in your personality, the brand <unk>
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies just <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other time to focus on the other time to focus on.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid the things that are <unk> and you actually get them back, and you actually go back and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands those things that have gone and come and come but a <unk> brand it's quite powerful.
MS: It's a <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand identity your brand, which would be?
You're a attribute of <unk> you are somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute attribute to <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like to be cool playful like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold or bold and bold as a <unk> faster or mystic or a mystic or a mystic or a mystic as a <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute to <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as a <unk>
You are a traditional established, it <unk> <unk> with <unk>
You are safe, stable, familiar familiar, safe, <unk> or wise familiar, as the Dalai Lama or <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> that they were saying they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they didn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how now we use magnetic MRI to identify the centers of desire to use magnetic resonance centers for the <unk>
We went to San <unk> where they have the advertising <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years for the last five years, there is no wall, no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts that companies are getting in schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest response to the most of you who have the most successful thing to do, with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to their <unk> they took them to their <unk> and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with it to create something different, something that is going to make people think that is going to challenge the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you to do it, they did it <unk>
Well, since the movie was sent in the <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a <unk> period.
That's just <unk> no press, no press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not in <unk> it's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk about it to their clients won't be <unk>
I've always believed that if you take any risks, if you take risks that in those risks there there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people of this is pushing to the failure.
I think when you train their employees in <unk> I believe that the risk of the whole company is preparing its entire company.
I feel that what it has to happen to make you progress that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that are able to <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to be <unk>
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of <unk> <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace risk.
And ultimately we have to support the transparency.
Today, more than never a bit of honesty is going to go down a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my whole talk about, the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> and bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: I mean, <unk> in the name of the transparency, that exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket -- I have a check, and name the TED matrix of TED, the <unk> Foundation to be applied to the TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest active to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that see these are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that they control and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> it's a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows on a laptop to a engineer to set up this gray box -- so we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> enters the gray box to the gray box, damages the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities in the <unk>
It seemed to want to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
It struck us attention, and we started an experiment that we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was happening with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after we experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, This is a <unk> <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So that's what I called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It could be, let's say, for example, a power of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to make the goal up. soon.
And then we took it and <unk> the attack code, and we found that there was <unk> in two bombs a little bit a big and big.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had their entire internal information.
We were all the points for the ones to attack.
You probably even know how much to <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language.
I want to tell you to tell you how we find it to find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at the beginning they were called the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and we were trying to engage them with the real data, and we tried to <unk> with the real world with potential targets.
We need to theories that we could pass it or <unk>
To get to theories of goals, remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> must be a <unk> white <unk> and it's probably located where most infections have been <unk>
You don't find several of them in that area.
It basically boils down to the power plant of the nuclear energy plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I became an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile phone within the <unk> that black thing you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even making the <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was that it was slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to <unk> engineers crazy to the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> that they're <unk> that <unk> and <unk> contains <unk>
That makes sense, a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what did we find in <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gives us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had to do with hands.
For not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead dead dead <unk>
Yet, we found that both digital digital <unk> to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> it's taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very comfortable in the fact that we've determined what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
I'm showing you some very interesting things that we saw a really interesting stuff that I saw me.
That's the gray box and the gray box <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of input sensors -- for example, from pressure sensors and an example of pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code.
And believe it or not, these false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood film where, in Hollywood where, the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could be <unk>
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine is passes speed, you have to open gold tubes.
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator, a human.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant.
And not the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it may be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is this <unk> <unk>
It doesn't have anything to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> of conditions.
It could also work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> which disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could use the conventional conventional technology of worms, <unk>
We can make it more possible.
And if you made that, what do we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the greatest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better we need to start to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There is one alone -- and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take up and that gives you skills to <unk> or another thing to make user chairs and get to walk.
<unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk> <unk>
They're nothing different from something that gets it in the morning, it gives you a great force to increase their speed, and help for example, how to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, it must take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and he is <unk> to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- in the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to your back.
We decided to contemplating this challenge and create a exoskeleton that I could help to manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take it down 90 pounds on the ground room for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows to be <unk> <unk> and <unk> movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then then increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, smart, industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the stare at wheelchair users of the wheels, what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 billion of people over and on the wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with damage in the spinal column, than at the age or 40 or 40 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair it turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is getting up to the population that are <unk>
His only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury, or a <unk> <unk>
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to begin to write a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who is using Amanda <unk> who had an injury in the <unk> column, and as a result of it couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It was completely not <unk> on the crutches that send signals to the TV computer on board here.
There's some batteries here that give power to engines on <unk> and in the knees, and make it move through this soft <unk>
AB: I was about 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, running cost <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> movement.
Little time later, a doctor walked to my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole me to the last bit of my hope of my being.
So the technology of adaptation since then, allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even building rocks and even ride up and even building a <unk>
But they've never invented me -- nothing that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change your life to the future generations -- not just from soldiers, but when I and all the chairs of the wheels to all of the wheels, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice to say hello, to say hello, and the game is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, of your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of rainforests in rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives closest <unk>
That means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother, an evolutionary grandmother about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much focused on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the mortal violence hasn't ever observed.
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths in the rainforest of <unk> and it has been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been given for decades and caused by almost so many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in the danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation, make it that you can't fill with or a stadium with the Bonobos that stay in the world -- and, honestly, we're not really confident about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden as <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> no longer they have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to deal with conflict and social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the lives of Bonobos is more than <unk>
At <unk> like humans, I love them to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them to play it is a fundamental thing to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
With it, we learn to <unk> and we learn with the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity and diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the <unk> roots, the same dance and the ritual ritual and the <unk>
The game is the glue they together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't talk about football.
Here is a female male and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what he is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> has <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual playing is common play as well as humans.
And this video really is interesting because we put this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of unusual elements of play -- like <unk> and also -- like the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and the same time it's more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with water who is playing with water.
I think that like that, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that that drives us to <unk> to interact. And then the unexpected connections that form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just tiny samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to to adapt to more and more difficult and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to really success to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's do it at the peak of your game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and human beings alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate -- play, can be the moments where the most urgent thing is.
So fellow primates, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as long as they <unk> creativity, friendship and <unk>
Thank you.
In New York in New York -- I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk> called the Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty as a captain of a captain of the fire <unk> in a fire body of <unk>
And in our city, where volunteer volunteers to a highly vessel -- you have to get to the fire site -- you have to go to the fire site very soon to go into the fire site.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was a career in the foot against the other volunteers to get the captain to charge and figure out what our homework.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly has one of the worst days of his life.
We were at high at night, she was standing out in the rain, she was standing out in a <unk> in his pajamas at a <unk>
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before me before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- got first to the captain and he asked him to go back and get to the dog owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a <unk> or <unk> of money for the rest of your life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a building to be alive just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman to a couple of shoes."
I am <unk>
It wasn't exactly exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went down to the firemen that had been down to the <unk> and entered the room to the room and went to the room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
We take from the house, the treasures for the house of home to house that was more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> <unk> effort to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at all over the way else was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling to volunteer -- of generosity or kindness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of a <unk> and the courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So, when I look in this room to people that have made or are by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind me of this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit to give, <unk>
They were <unk> in a dining room, a <unk>
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
And so I trained to <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in <unk> with a very simple idea, images of a fixed measure of a fixed measure, <unk>
Very quickly, these became very quickly, the most used unit of building it became used in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger things than us, as buildings or bridges at the block at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, in 1947, the <unk> came out.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It is estimated that over 400 billion or 75 to each person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or your home.
<unk> it made it accessible.
It just took it to just adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Financial labs labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would lead to a world of the aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just as the concrete block allows to create much greater circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference for experts.
I don't personally believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of the engineers of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules every one with a specific function.
They are <unk> to be light, sound, and sound, and <unk>
And the best thing about everything is come together by magnets.
So you can't put in wrong way.
<unk> bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is <unk> the blue is the input and the orange is the input and the orange color.
So you just have to assemble a blue one, and you can very quickly start to make bigger circuits.
An blue blue one is producing light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we can have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We have this <unk> <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to be connecting and connect and <unk> it allows us to program using <unk> very simple gestures of <unk>
To make it faster or <unk> you just turn this button to this button that makes your pulse faster or faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a higher collection of <unk>
We want all the interactions in the world are going to be <unk> bricks ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given kids to see them to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light from night, or why does a <unk> be open to the touch.
We've also taken to the design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience in electronics experience with <unk> as a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk>
A few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, we took them to the design of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island -- who don't have experience some engineering experience and we said, "Give them something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this stuff this stuff is in the order of everyone.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is us.
So let's go ahead and forth.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment to focus on.
<unk> <unk>
This is a little video video that we do.
Let me take you a moment.
You can take a little on <unk>
<unk> we can continue better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I heard me the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work that for a year and to work that for us to work to work on the government. We asked them to work in the government.
The initiative called <unk> <unk> and it would be like a <unk> <unk>
We put some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting me to the Third World <unk> we send them to the wild world.
They worked great did great work to work with <unk>
His job is to show the possibilities of current technology.
You get to <unk>
So when I was in the city of Boston.
Here is as if I would find a quote, but what is it looking for a quote, but what is it for someone to clean when you were caught up in the snow because you know it's not very good at home when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it be to ask for help for aid in this way.
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February of the course of the past time -- so much last year.
They realized that city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: <unk> the sidewalks in front of them.
So it made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- <unk> the last year.
But it does something that no other technology technology <unk>
And it spreads in <unk>
A responsible for the city of the city of <unk> by looking at this app that he realized it could be done not for <unk> but for the citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of the tsunami, but the people are <unk>
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to make it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we have to use it.
And this has been <unk> and this is a natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on three and a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to pick up the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by normal channels, would have taken at least two years and left two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California power of California that until the moment has gone up to 2,000 million dollars and not work.
And there are projects like this on every level of the government.
So an app that comes to a couple of days and it spreads into viral and a viral warning to the institution of the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not like in private companies, not as many people think it should be.
Nor do a technological company, but as a technological company, but as the Internet itself.
I mean, without excellent in and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way we can address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a collective institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good at collective action for the digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people that are building tools to make them together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> every day in their own communities.
You haven't given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that but not <unk> the <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, I row in the <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put them crazy, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because is alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you are one of those people, you would ask you that you're going to do it.
Politics is not <unk> the government yes.
And because the government at the last one, we remember that the <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to be able to <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, a matter of <unk>
This is the health care center.
It is the place that serves the calls if you make a untouched in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the bottom of official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of your house, and put it very strong and very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a web and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> that app.
It was the work of very intelligent people from the Office of New York City, by Boston.
So one day, this thing happened -- this is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of waste. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about the person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is audience, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the end of the house I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income income of the government to <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for the people to focus and help each other.
So a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
He connected to the two people.
And they might have connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps you to raise the communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people who are <unk> but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input system is <unk>
How many times have been chosen to a <unk> leader, we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like immense and politics and politics is the surface of the superficial <unk>
At least it's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that that belongs to that something that is that we had to develop something that works in our against that other thing, and we're losing the power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy <unk>
Because that's where the real work is happening.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they've written a very detailed report report.
That's not a politician, that's political activism.
And for the ones that have been <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to do that we face.
Do you really believe that we have to go where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't stop government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root machinery so the government function so that it can be <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows it's not so hard to perform <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of age is 28 years old, so I myself, <unk> I am a major generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown to the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face that <unk> they're going to talk.
They can express their opinions at any of the same time and they do.
So when the government problem the government problem is no matter how to do some of your voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring the hands to the work for the work to work better and make it better work.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a fire fire, taking out a bucket of garbage that has a <unk>
Of course, we were always able to <unk> those hydrants and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that not only are consumers, we're not just consumers of government in our taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or or we will be a crowd of your hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of time in the prisons, prisons and prisons and death.
I've spent most of my life in community communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing and hearing these stimulus has given me.
One of the things I noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this is because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we see fantastic <unk>
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach yourself with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the understanding of the law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional <unk> family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, strong, had power.
It was the last word <unk> in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents born in slavery in the slavery in Virginia about the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery to <unk> the way the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was <unk>
When I was little, she looked at me and looked at me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to me, and I was going to tell me, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he told me that no, I'm going to tell me again and if I said yes, I gave me in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that it had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins was running around all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up in the room, and I went to the room and I were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and he looked at him and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, he took me out of his hand, and he said, "Come on <unk> <unk> we're going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't tell you -- I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, and I looked down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you like."
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just I want me three things, three things, <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "Do the first I want me to tell me, you always want to get to your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to claim that you always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then the second one I want to tell me, "The second one I want you to tell me, you are always going to be the right thing to do.
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then then he said, "The third I I want you to tell me is that never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field in <unk> I have a brother for a older year and a sister and a older year year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us my sister and I went to the forest.
We can barely get the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little kid and offered to me to my sister, she took a little offered to me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You don't <unk> but I'm not going to <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing as you do.
I already took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can tell you <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I came up with the head of <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is being <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is thinking that it's a <unk> I'm saying that it has the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to do things that don't really make any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe you can do.
I think my private grandmother creates that all his grandchildren believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that are, according to it, we should have <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners. prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
We have the United States in the United States, the world's <unk>
We have seven million people in a parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, poor communities, they find so much <unk> so despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men among the 18 and 30 years in jail or in jail or a parole.
In urban urban from all over the country, Los Angeles, North Baltimore from 50 to 60 60 60 60 60 60 percent of the color young young men are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, in the race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a system that is a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger to make us believe that these are not problems with ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some <unk> <unk>
In my state, as in Alabama, as in the other states, you care about the rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of male population population has ever lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years the level of rights to be as much as it was before the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where the children of 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country jail for children, without possibility of <unk>
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were <unk> people on death row in death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
But in a sense you've got to think that the final question, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die from the <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes in <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by error.
For every nine people have been identified -- one that is innocent that is that he is <unk> and released from the death row, who is <unk> and thrown out of the death.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is interesting.
And in aviation they wouldn't be allowed to fly airplanes if they were about every nine to nine that would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my class with students in the history of <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and the second of the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, was a little defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The terror of terror was what their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and tell me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give me to the people who stop saying that in our history deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, say, "No. <unk> we grew with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic for us to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what historically we've done.
All the time <unk> each other.
We were constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that he could not get rid of racial segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done.
I was in Germany giving talks about death <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's good for you to hear what you're going to <unk>
<unk> We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never have it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady who said, "No way to our history, we could never get into the systematic of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> we would put us to <unk>
Tell me about this.
How do we focus on a world where a nation like Germany, and <unk> to people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We could do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things that are <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But then, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
lately recently, we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that that means I want to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, <unk> those who never come to TED.
And thinking about it is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's really that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, as committed to the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, with creativity. The development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas by <unk> too.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at just how brilliant it <unk> but also in the dark and it also will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> <unk> talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, to spirit, the spirit of to be in websites and be <unk> and <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I think, even in communities as a TED needs to <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design and design, that allow us to truly be human if we don't pay attention for your attention to your attention to the <unk> to the injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts are going to make a much more challenging identity than if we do this stuff.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege -- as a very young lawyer from meeting to Rosa -- to <unk>
These women were together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady I was called me to say, <unk> comes from <unk> and we're going to get to talk about it.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. I know I do."
Then she would say, "Well, what do you do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I went and just the <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And when I was there, I was listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, "OK, let's tell me what this idea of justice <unk>
You get what you're trying to do."
And I started to give me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk> <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice administration.
We try to stop the <unk> of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to stop the <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best and end up and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> was <unk> he put my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with those challenges, that problems.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I have learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst one we have.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure that if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people that must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very beautiful, very very beautiful, very <unk> are not judge for our technology, for our designs, and our rational capacity to our intellectual capacity.
At the end, the character of a society, not for the way they deal with the rich, powerful and <unk> but in the way as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it is in this context as we started to understand real issues really profound things that we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, you know.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, who have been <unk> to get them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to someone in what is not it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was wake up, <unk> -- my <unk> can turn you into something that you don't are, you must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has <unk> powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a <unk> black.
I started to work on <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my black <unk> Jewish customer as a <unk> <unk> <unk> white <unk>
In the <unk> I put there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of police and the <unk>
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but all a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking about that <unk> word would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it was sent to the cut.
It was about two months ago, I had forgotten there.
And finally, I would say, "I'm going to the court for this case stupid. stupid.
I went up to the car and I was really <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And finally I went down from the car.
I was going to go up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he's <unk> "It's you.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I was <unk> in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
It profoundly connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the audiences.
By there, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, I was Mr. <unk> and we started <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was that there was written those crazy things.
They came the cops the <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. We all talked about races, because we talked about races, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I hit see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and you would hear all that <unk>
You walk around and walking around for you and there.
Finally, this old black, with his face of concern, he went in the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
And during the break a <unk> <unk> I showed you, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk>
And the black black stood up foot, he looked at me and he looked at me and he looked at me and he said, "You know, <unk> to this young audiences to keep her view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't really be human human beings if we don't care about human rights, and for the dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
What our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this -- I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> of hearing and see a clear <unk> desire to hear and see the <unk> desire for your <unk>
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> of this spring -- which is going to be a effort to get the funds to the funds to the funds to the funding that are they spend today in exchange of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years -- a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
So this <unk> is going to come up with this <unk> of these funds to the law to make it to the law of the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decrease in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you tell you that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong for the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain for rob a bicycle, a little crimes against ownership of the property, rather than making it <unk> those resources into their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
I think that our current philosophy today about punishment on the punishment it doesn't do nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited to be excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years or the last six years or the last six years.
The idea is that the media of the press would rather be aware of negative news, because our minds pay you attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses, our senses get many, many more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than to survive, the first stop of all this data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could cause us to harm us.
So from a <unk> of stories of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all the digital devices give us to give you any negative news for a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we're <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century, by a series of forces -- so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems climate change, the <unk> <unk> water water and water <unk> you have no doubts and <unk>
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and, at the long end we just have them.
Let's look what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average income per capita of the inflation per capita by inflation is <unk> throughout the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, of the transportation of transportation and transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy is about 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are going to <unk>
And we continue to <unk> higher expectations every time.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> in the United States, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water and <unk> television television television and air conditioning -- television and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air conditioning and air
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would have never dreamed of, would you have dreamed of like that <unk>
And so much of this is a lot of the technology and the technology and the exponential growth.
My friend of my friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any of the information <unk> of the information technology is going to Moore's Law, and Moore's Law, and doubling the price for about 12 to 24 months.
And for that reason that mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper to a supercomputer than the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in the war and <unk> in the <unk>
It's the outcome of fast computers used to building faster computers quickly.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on the left to the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is getting faster and faster.
And in this curve, <unk> from Moore's Law, there is a series of technologies that we today.
The computation in the cloud, my friends of <unk> they call infinite sensors and sensors and networks, to the robotic printing and its ability to democratize three-dimensional production and distribute personalized production around the planet, biology and synthetic biology, vaccines and the food medicine and the digital medicine and the digital medicine and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that they <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in your mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk>
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve great challenges of humanity.
And every year -- we asked them to release a company, or a service or the service that may be able to positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have a kind of <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think to create abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for each <unk> on the planet, it's about creating a life of it.
It's about taking it and make it <unk> <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> history.
He's the kind of the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The Napoleon troops they ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with carbon <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is in the aluminum of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of Earth, doesn't come as metal and just <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as a <unk>
So let's take this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a <unk> planet for more than we used in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about support, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees versus <unk>
The cost of solar <unk> it took 50 percent of the last year.
Last month, MIT was published a study showing that in the end of the decade, the sunlight parts of the United States, the solar power will cost six cents in the hour compared to six cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars by water.
Remember when Carl Sagan was called Voyager Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
You get a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet.
We live on a planet on a planet in a <unk>
Yes, <unk> is seawater, two percent of the water is ice, and it is ice, and <unk> and <unk> from the water <unk>
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, it comes <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I would like to share with you with you to give me your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the <unk> it's the size of a refrigerator size.
It is able to generate 1,000 gallons of drinking water to the day from any <unk> source, <unk> water <unk> by less than two cents the gallon.

If that comes out good, and I have a lot of confidence in which Coca-Cola is going to be a Coca-Cola in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation, this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world in the end developing world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications in the middle of Kenya that the president is 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that the president Clinton is 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted that ever.
Better than that, what you and I have paid paid tens and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video <unk> and music, technology and diagnostic technology are now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe they get the best to get the health applications in.
Last month, I had the pleasure to <unk> the <unk> Foundation is something called <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies together in a mobile device with which you talk, and because it has <unk> you can get rid of your blood finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
So imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world that there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> from the health care workers -- is about 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device <unk> a virus or RNA DNA or DNA is that not <unk> and in the first place, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the largest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion people are never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you get? What do you <unk>
And instead of a economic collapse, we have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars of dollars in the global economy.
And most health care about the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and computing Academy and the computer is going to be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never even <unk>
What if we give you the <unk> wherever you are, a voice to be <unk> and you can act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams of his passion with a goal of of course, can do things with <unk> things that had only the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that I'm really <unk>
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to be the way that protein.
The folds determine the structure and <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem with <unk>
They've played with this university professors among other people who have been played with the <unk>
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started to <unk>
And it's been shown today that the machinery of animal recognition machinery is better for better than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three three of these new minds that are <unk> to work in the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a lot of very extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give me three examples to give you three examples.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may think it was <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as <unk>
It was <unk>
It caught a long until the decade of the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that nothing has nothing special.
But the case we still are in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a drug in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could tell you that.
I burned very much with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not out there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 feet, the <unk> of black <unk>
And fishing from this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so I became more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years after the amount of fish had gone down to half.
I went to the five centimeters at the five inches.
We have genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing about changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, they said, <unk> in the <unk> Europe was done so many projects.
The fishing development was to impose was to <unk> the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this would boat, quite ugly, <unk> <unk>
I went out to fish out in the South <unk> and we did in the South China Sea Sea, and especially everything in the Ross Sea.
What we had we capture was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, the bottom of the sea floor.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals in the background.
And most fish are blobs tiny tiny blobs on some of the remains of a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then the commercial fishery
The background is going to be a solid heart fund, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we capture a living.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be able to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't believe the world, but we don't remember.
We would take the start to go to the start, again, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this stuff something like this.
On the y-axis we have things like biodiversity, <unk> <unk> from the country, the water supply, the water supply, the water supply.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life like normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the action of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping some <unk>
And that, in great point, we want to do right now.
We want to keep things that are no longer are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to two generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before you <unk> it's <unk>
One is not lost animals.
You have a lost animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a big loss.
At the time, we focus on the big, we focus on the big animals and a sea in a sea with a great fish.
They become <unk> because they were <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think this is the point of <unk>
And the question is: why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, it was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect them to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them present, like captain and such looked as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, generally they don't use the use scientists of fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous paper that it can perform a protected marine zone.
Because with the protected zones, they actually <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been run and very low.
That's for the people you can see a protected areas and they can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which lets them erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do that because they have no access, as people in the Middle West for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema -- maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about how people were moved with the film, I'm talking about the history of <unk> why <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, it has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that give, <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> manager of <unk>
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But the video video now makes any of us, or of our copper actions, <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Any of you may be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
It gets over 48 hours of video video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only a little percentage percentage is viral has got lots and lots of visits and <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> their communities of the communities and three of surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside of his house in National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the popularity of the last last summer.
<unk> I didn't set up to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> <unk> video.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> will show us new and interesting things to a larger audience.
RS:
<unk> de Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph is the frequency of use.
Just just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was true. Well, it was true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators to embrace a view and share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great joke, then he starts to talk about that and to do things.
And now there are 10,000 feet of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation -- they come with a <unk>
That's it. That's it.
This year it was about 50 million times.
And if you think that it's rare, you know that there is a <unk> version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that it is creativity that I woke up with the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the ancient <unk>
And then they became international made.
All of a sudden, a whole community emerged that it would happen to be a <unk> <unk> to something that we all can be part of what we can do.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk>
What script could have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world you go up two days in the world two days of video video days, only the absolutely unique and unexpected can make it so that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy that <unk> against <unk> in New York, I admit that I never became interested in.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> it <unk> the <unk> but often there are very much obstacles who prevent you to circular <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise of the surprise and your humor, Casey Casey <unk> I had that five million you saw and understand it.
So this approach is worth all of the new things that we do the <unk>
And all this leads to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend creative communities -- that's the characteristics of a new kind of media, of participation, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current <unk> <unk> Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, they are just the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> whose entire life whose entire life had been supported by unique and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> enter the fact that his life will come in <unk> the fact that his life had been entirely in vain.
The words for so long, my friends, for both of the time.
They lie in silence.
He died failed for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My assignment was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to learn how to <unk>
The next piece of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was so 18 years old, when his father died, and a little marriage marriage <unk>
For her, life had been destined for a task to <unk> the escape and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her who could not do this.
And after the <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat is managed to the sea Sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of the <unk> the rape and the death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with a poison.
If we were <unk> we first would take my sister and I, and then my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rate of the engine, the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the dying and they cannot jump for for six hours.
But I know the lights of the oil platform, in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he died, he was going to finish the journey was too much to it, and the first apple that I knew I knew was given by the men of the platform.
None apple apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four generations over three generations to make a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of kind of <unk> whose population is comprised of cotton.
Unlike the middle class in the middle class in the middle class -- whose existence of the middle class -- there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores they were from shops to the rest of the world.
And the bits of English English is being traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then in a car assembly -- working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars had been <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and math, not mind what it should be <unk> that usually was <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there was <unk> rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back away.
At home, where is where when we are.
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> on the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we went on on our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered <unk>
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then he studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women came with their stories of their stories they could not make the transition mad and <unk> and <unk> caught stuck in two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
They created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical students with what they <unk> from myself.
In the other, I was <unk> in the <unk> lives in <unk> of drugs and <unk> for drug abuse, their abuse of drug abuse and their isolation.
But many of them have been given to the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer we chose to the oldest year of a year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but the edges don't <unk>
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to talk about sites that had never heard and in homes whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire the <unk> and the feeling of life in the life of life in a <unk> -- a mother and two daughters ending the day for almost 20 years, and made the three up of three still in the very bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we went to the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> he said, "What is not <unk>
So I talked to <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more I was talking about it was <unk>
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of possible.
And although I ended my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized the same time it's going to be a unknown, a new <unk> new in the scene -- and not only do it -- but it's something that being grateful, maybe maybe a gift gift.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort that I know that the world would be <unk> but not in the way that we fear -- but not in the way that we fear that we fear is not in the way that we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk>
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare <unk> of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
You know, a small group of people to whom the motto cannot be <unk> it was a <unk>
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I did a giant <unk> <unk>
They go back to the time at the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ideas, and we open up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later had me to <unk> and the adventure.
Before the end, let me just tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At <unk> it became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support his husband, it caused the <unk> to the <unk> and bringing it to the cause and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it proved wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel that when she died, one <unk> miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower I saw in the side of the shower and I saw it on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist Buddhist <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is it hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken from the <unk> he said.
They have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we are, how life we are, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have become <unk>
The defeat would be easily <unk>
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to do that for you? Right?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a brave one in every wave, constant rate, the vast horizon of the engine, the vast horizon that don't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give you just to you and see you secure it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today in the fourth or <unk>
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were a conversation about how nothing changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians we want to travel to a car and they were <unk> the sky.
Now we do with airplanes.
At that time, when I went to the big prince warrior late, he had <unk> I would pull a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The realization that we took it was that the machinery had replaced to magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I gave me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't blame my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow me to magic not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver pocket.
And this piece of the 50 years that was the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world and a <unk> of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense that mobile phones and the luxury clocks and the cameras stop that <unk>
Tell us our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came back to this technological world to this technological world to see how it would use to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad -- I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where do we are.
And the text of the text with the image, he animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we love that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And this --  He says, "This is <unk> <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character in the book.
At a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes to me.
My interior child is interested in all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but at the age of childhood, those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar of fireflies in the jar of fireflies in a complete <unk>
So over here, we have to go through the iPad to release the fireflies.
And I actually light your way out of the way it hits the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl in a <unk>
So here every book and every book and every world and every world and every world would go into this magic device.
And this opens a map.
In the entire book of fantasy there has always been maps but have static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain spots of the book are also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content, and to the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside of India know their counterparts -- <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in oil cameras, during the millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk>
And in a history that is present issues current like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years have been to children have been attached to their <unk> they haven't left to the outside.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with the technology.
One of the bodies of the book is this adventure that you need to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and you can collect images from different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't do it.
So to get this ritual of the childhood ritual to go out and in a <unk> chapter one photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, I need to take a picture of the cortex, the <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within different variants of the magic, the Earth and the Earth and the technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we have to have an interaction where you go with the iPad and the video on it on and through the <unk> and through the <unk> and through the <unk> <unk> of the inner plants.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves with a <unk>
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you're going to get to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and the technology and the technology and the technology are coming to each other.
Let's take the energy of the sun.
We're moving to our children and ourselves into the natural world and to that magic, <unk> joy and love and <unk> joy and love that with a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why so many projects of <unk>
And I think, really, that most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a CEO of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a small cup of coffee or tea and asked patients and family and <unk> what wrong <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they don't have to listen to.
This is my <unk> It's very simple.
It's a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge you can see.
I got the challenge to 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get to me, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem of weight, not at the same moment as you need to be <unk> or some urgency of that style of that, but you can see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As a few of you -- you know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my <unk> <unk> and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing it can happen because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also to stop patients from smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a <unk>
And people who are <unk> from their homes, take their blood pressure, attached to their doctor and share it with each other, for example, by 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back to the control and be captains of their own <unk> but also it can also help care about health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of attention to <unk> <unk> the demand for demand and other issues.
And the techniques that are very simple techniques to use and start with this to engage patients into the patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks checks and <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> are <unk> in <unk>
But where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food seats.
But where is the closest <unk> <unk>
We did but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this moment.
What we did is we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please see that <unk> please see where, and when it's open, you just open up in the office and you're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step next was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find out these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- you can use your iPhone, and to the weeks and next weeks to use your job of Microsoft to find the nearest <unk>
And from today, I'd like to introduce this to this one, not just as <unk> -- which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish it to the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that will help us find, to work and work like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And I'd like to invite companies around the world in the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be services of how to be messaging and people from <unk> for example, to see the <unk> which is still in its place.
Please let me go on this and not just improve your health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share with <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
It mixed up with my previous passion for drawing but it was a little different because when I use the camera in the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that it ends up when you get the <unk>
For me the photograph I had more to be at the right place with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to make something different, a process that would start the <unk>
<unk> like this: <unk> a very <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I might be able to <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as photography.
I mean, you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real?
They're the details or <unk>
Do you call the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it is about our way to interpret the world, and how you can perceive on a <unk>
It's actually not about as realistic as realistic as we think it's a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way, you can create something that it still seems <unk> as if you were there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain is because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to look like realistic and I think those ones that don't even ignore the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important -- because in the other way, something is very important to <unk>
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to be able to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos you must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos combine you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are played with these <unk> were taken to the same height of light.
The third point is making the third thing impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of pictures of different places.
And I think it is easier to create a place that you can find out because you don't need to put in danger the ideas you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter I knew it had several months months to find the different locations for the puzzle.
For example, the fish were captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made the red house the top of the island of the island of the island itself.
So to make a realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures it can be very beautiful, and it can be very beautiful at the time.
All the tools are there and the only limit our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please do it <unk>
It's a diagram that I took out of a portfolio that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details of the details, I'm not interested in showing you so much.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of the microprocessors versus the power of the local area of the local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> it's new.
Here's something strange here.
And I'm just going to talk.
Please turn the lights.
It was more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we have technological curves on technological scales.
The answer is that if you draw the drawing on a normal <unk> where, say, these are the years, or a unit of time, and this would be any measure of technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk>
If the technology of the <unk> transport technology as fast as we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in Tokyo in the Tokyo in the Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But we don't go through that <unk>
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development -- that every few years, moving orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- look at these <unk> <unk> we see that we don't keep forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
We get one of two things.
Or is it going to become a typical curve for a <unk> I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe it might happen something like this.
And so now we would be in the middle of this way.
In this line we're in a transition in this transition that used to be the world in a <unk>
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, ask myself, is what new world?
What new state is going to the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we are engaged in it.
I remember a child in the future happening year and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year in 2000.
That's all you see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after a year in my life.
But I think it must feel that something is happening.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is going to be so different that you are doing today not make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it could be that that transition you can be <unk>
But to do that to have to talk a little bit of things that have to talk a little bit of things that don't have much to do with technology.
Because I think the only way to understand that the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two and two billion years when the Earth was a giant rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around.
If we see the way that we organized these chemicals we give us an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theories there to start to understand the origin of RNA.  I'm going to tell you a simple version of this simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, I had floating <unk> some of the chemical recipes in its inside.
Some of those drops of oil was a particular combination of chemicals that made materials from the outside and so <unk> <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those are the most <unk> cell shapes those <unk> those oil.
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because every one of them had a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that <unk>
So each of them was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time of adding the chemical chemists grew more chemicals and <unk>
They were mostly <unk> they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple, but the things become interesting and interesting <unk> when these drops <unk>
In some ways we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical chemist called DNA.
In other words, we were going to be in this evolution of no meaning, a writing system that allowed them to log them to record what they were allowed to <unk>
The amazing thing is that the writing system seems stable to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that writing system of writing.
In fact, every living being living is expressed in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of the white dust that I try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data that we tend to use in -- and I wrote it down to 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What's the next <unk>
Writing DNA was a interesting step.
This made these cells happily happy another billion years.
But then another big step came up in the fact that things are going to be very different and that these cells started to exchange and it was that these cells started to exchange and to communicate information forming these cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to the antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their small DNA DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because the bacteria are <unk>
So this communication gave place to be able to be able to get communities that were going to be able to do that, and a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> and it is that if a community was very successful all the individuals from that community to become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a chain of a DNA supply chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities we have communities in many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no equal without the heart, or the muscles or so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phones -- something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the <unk> of the information that those cell communities are built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures to understand and to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains were and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as a <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of time.
So a organism, you can, for example, learn to don't eat any fruit because I knew it was sick and sick for the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had been building these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years per death of the individuals who ate that fruit that ate that fruit
And so the fact that the nervous nervous system is to build a huge evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the <unk>
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a <unk> idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here doing a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea like that, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved by mine.
But we do something very complicated that we turn it into sound, on sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
Now we went through similar periods for similar to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> and the <unk> of information and the <unk> of information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the video, the video, the video, and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and capable of evolved more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales scales again.
The first stages of history that I tell you took out a billion years each.
The next stages, nervous and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
And then the pieces, the language and so on.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process <unk> <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own <unk>
The more changes, the more changes, the more changes, the way you go.
And I think that's what we look at this explosion of curve.
We see that process <unk>
But I do my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs that work to be not possible without the general advances in recent technology.
But now I design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There's billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and we put it on the machine and that thing to do something that you could never do before.
In fact, sometimes times using methods that don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please give a hundred million instructions of instructions to the <unk>
You could run these sequences of unexpected instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order a numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more and more of the programs that we find the ones that sort of <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, it could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that make the <unk>
And they <unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I'm going to tell the best we give them the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analogous <unk>
Let's take two programs, who are <unk> children, who are <unk> and the kids will bring them to the properties of these two programs.
So we get a new generation of programs that have a little bit more than success.
And we say, "Please follow the <unk>
Let's get it again.
We have some <unk>
And it tries to try and get it back to another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So, I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that <unk> very perfect.
In fact, it's a lot more efficient programs than I could be written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to run to see how they work.
These are dark programs.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal to get the goal out of a hundreds of thousands of programs that they do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on fact, their lives they depend on.
Once I was going on a 747 in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> an airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to give them a <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that enables us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices we are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a much faster computers and so can be able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so fast I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at the analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I believe that something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part that we think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I believe that all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now I'm going to go lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've spent enough time for me to give up to my false <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk> the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> <unk> talking about statistics and use to use a big team of baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them, and I hope that a lot of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300, a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat means three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the game of the game without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to get to the first base of <unk> it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> on the Great <unk>
Well, well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call <unk> baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody than 10 <unk> they get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the New League <unk> in a regular season.
Now let's take this into my world of medicine where I feel so much more awkward, or less uncomfortable, after what I'm telling you to today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has a <unk> record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place in a remote and a dear has two arteries -- <unk> and his family doctor headed to a cardiologist whose world record is 200 <unk>
But you know something?
She's getting a lot over this year.
And their hits has been <unk>
This is not working.
But you will ask:
What do you believe must be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a <unk>
They are very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is it <unk> to the world, and I would tell me to be a perfect <unk>
They never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I found when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs to a blood test.
Such a which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of the General at the General of the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
From my class of <unk> <unk> the origin of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> -- the frequent <unk>
And I even knew the difference are <unk> about how to be <unk> <unk>
And as well as you get more and more knowledge.
And I was really good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if everything -- so close to everything, because it would be more possible, because I'm going to get away from the <unk> because I got rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met <unk>
I was a resident in a college in a college in Toronto when they brought the lady in the emergency service where I worked where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when emergency thesis I think is to go to a cardiologist to go to a <unk>
And reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lunch lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard about it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart leaves it will work and instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood is going to our lungs, these blood will get out to your lungs, that's so difficult to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I put it to work in the treatment that he was <unk>
I gave him aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave you water pills so I could get rid of the water <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent to his house.
I actually made two mistakes more.
I sent her home to his house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I'd have been able to <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make me a constant.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even standing to my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it back to his house, he didn't pay attention to a voice on my interior, who said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so unsure that I was asked to the nurse from being to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is well if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I think that being right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed by the high and the ambulance with the ambulance with the ambulance with her <unk>
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a <unk> on your stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I got to leave the hospital, and I walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home, and I did something that I do something that I don't do usually, in that moment I did something that I don't do normally do anything, I do something that I don't make normally normally normally, I did something that I don't do
I went on the emergency emergency emergency room at home.
And then another nurse, not who was taking care of the lady -- but another one, said to me three words, that three words of emergency emergency emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear people too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the <unk> patients.
The three words are remembers you you?
She remembers the patient that sent to their <unk>
And I asked the other nurse to complete <unk>
And then she <unk> with the same kind of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of the death.
After an hour of having come home to her house, after I had my high school, I had a collapse, and her family brought to the emergency emergency room with 50 millimeters from 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock shock of 50 millimeters of <unk>
I was just breathing and blue.
The emergency staff would make all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and expected against all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days days that never come to <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together together.
And in eight or nine days or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And by the ninth day, they let them go. My <unk> <unk> wife, <unk>
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was struck by it and I experienced it for the first time <unk> which is in our medical culture and I felt alone, <unk> no feeling that healthy shame because you can't do it with your colleagues.
You make our peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad at it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we made it bad, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that I would get out the things and made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I asked my <unk> why did he sent their home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake that <unk> so <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on a day he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I was wondering if I would feel better at me again.
And I made a deal with me in the same thing that if you were making the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, you would give you those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department of emergency emergency hospital in a community in the north of Toronto, and I got to a man in 25 years with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed here.
I watched his throat, I was a little <unk>
He threw it out and he sent her home.
But while he was going to the door followed his throat. It was still pointing out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to my head of guard, my head of guard, to talk to me with me in his office.
And I made three words: remember you?
Remember the patient to see a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can see it in Google. It's an infection, not by the throat, but from the top, and the top, and that may be the close <unk>
him, fortunately, it doesn't <unk>
They get <unk> antibiotics down to <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I was <unk> and I went back to work, and again, and again.
Two times on the same turn turn to the <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because he was <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculus
I was <unk> an X-ray of it, but it turns out normal. A colleague who I was checking the patient perceived to some sensitivity in the bottom right and called a <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague of me to <unk>
I looked at it, and at the bottom of some sensitivity in the bottom right, in the lower right-hand corner.
Both were both operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of and like a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and not support.
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how to can share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this to not make the same <unk>
If I could go back to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea of what you think about me.
When did the last time you heard someone talking to failure, after failure, after anybody.
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg is going to have a wrong leg.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> those who make mistakes -- and the ones that don't sleep sleep, and you know, those who have great results and ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you bring the medicine to the people that make mistakes, you will get a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In about 20 years about diffusion and a medical journalism study -- I've done as possible, from the first article I wrote to the Star Trek to my <unk> <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, Black <unk> white, Black <unk> white, Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every single 10 drug drugs are <unk> or <unk> is wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system that <unk> infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos.
In this country, they die 24 Canadian Canadian medical mistakes are <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute of America.
In both of both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so these are things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is about every two or three years, and we don't get ourselves to it.
<unk> sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with alcohol -- and all of a sudden, my history was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get to us, and we eliminate all the professionals and we eliminate to all the professionals -- most of the potential to error, well, you're not going to be no one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> white, arts art. <unk> it's my custom, and I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery -- to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone for them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> the head and they start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do that.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, human and human knows -- you know, you accept it, and you don't forget about your mistakes, but you try to learn about how it happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about mistakes.
We do the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and a loving and loving and support for everyone to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, are they made mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, we were going to be a <unk>
And I feel so I feel so much, but I get to learn to learn something that can be <unk>
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that say, pick up a half a half a day.
It doesn't make a lot about research on a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks by these CEOs and the time that we have to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>
Naturally, every work involved in a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just a 12 percent required for an hour or more of it time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we practice the way that decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and in some possible solutions.
While I'm talking about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you do a question, if your response is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> the University of a very, very sophisticated <unk>
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was such as 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different kinds of water and vegetables and some of the 25 water -- and this was when we take water from the <unk>
I loved to go to that shop, but at one occasion, asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is <unk> <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones who were in the <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He gave me the buses full of tourists that were going to every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
I took a post to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or <unk> or a different flavors and we see two things: First, when people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there were only six six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
When there were only stopped when there were only three percent he got to buy <unk>
When you had six six, we saw 30 percent bought in <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, they were six.
Well, let's decide that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> we are good at <unk> <unk> but it turns out that the problem is the overload of choices you will make in good <unk>
We decided not to decide, even if this doesn't bother us.
Right now the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe you to a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in which we observe the decisions of savings for about a million Americans, in between 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at the number of <unk> funding plans for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save for the future.
And we discovered that really there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the most of it was the number of <unk> funds there were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, you see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation or more, not as high as it would be.
And in the plans that give me to put about 60 <unk> the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that decided to to participate, the most of it was the number of choices, more people are <unk> to avoid their actions or their hedge funds.
As much as more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade before, we've seen three main negative consequences will give you more and more possibilities.
It's likely to be <unk> that the decision, even when it is to be against self-interest.
It is more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in the health.
They are more likely to pick up things less than <unk> even though objectively them better.
The main reason is to be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to do the calculations for <unk> by contrast and choosing that amazing <unk>
Today I want to tell you four simple techniques that we've gone from a way or another, in different research, so you can test in your businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it has never been more true than today, less than today, less to be longer.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're looking at it every time is that if you choose to cut, you get rid of strange <unk> -- so there will be an increase in sales, there will be a better experience of the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> eliminated by the products for junk products that are fewer and lower costs.
You know, the supermarket is known to today, at the average of today, give 45 products.
In a Walmart store it's about 100,000 dollars products.
But the most big store in the world in the world now it's <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce guy.
In the financial savings world that I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the best choices you have from David <unk> the <unk>
All the employees at Harvard are <unk> to automatically <unk>
Those who really want to choose, you give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know people often say, "I don't know how you <unk>
They are all <unk> options.
The first thing I do first is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences you have between those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was <unk>
He said to me that would be willing to give people out of this audience a holiday with the entire paid road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that minute.
I think I really think I would hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second one, I can tell you and say that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
And this brings me to the second technique to drive the overload problem of the choices it is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average, when they use debit or credit and credit than when they use it to be used.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> of <unk> <unk> that worked in <unk> these people were in a <unk>
And that meeting that we were exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
And what we added is that the staff that would tell the staff to think about the positive things that you would put in your lives if you save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to put on their <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than we can make more categories more choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway that we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the supermarkets of <unk> along the <unk> <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the categorization indicates it is how to <unk>
These are two displays of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other <unk>
If you think the left to the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk>
<unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the left to the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out that's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This standard framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell us something that <unk> not as <unk>
You can often see this problem with these huge <unk>
They're supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, is just a little bit more information than what we think, is just a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision <unk> the purchase of a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that enables <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 choices to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices every one.
<unk> outside of the car, I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary by order where the order of decisions.
So half the customers are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, a few examples, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to be a few choices, four boxes, all <unk> colors, 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What as involved in you are.
If you were <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to them, and the default button and over and over and over again, and another one of it.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options for many, they keep there.
The same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order where information comes from.
If we start with how easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box box is not saying nothing about the preferences of <unk> inside, in all ways you get to choice.
We are excited about a product that we are building that we are more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem with the overload of <unk> choices: we would get rid of the <unk> alternatives -- so we can do it <unk> we can drive more categories at least <unk>
All of these techniques that I've presented to them were designed were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for them to be able to use them in their business, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to what I think the key to getting the best of choice is to be careful at <unk>
And the more careful choices we can do is we can practice art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East Germany <unk> if you had a typewriter was to write it before the government.
I had to record a picture of the text of the example written with the machine.
And that the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a written message with the wrong message they could track the footprint into the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that does it -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color printer printer and it prints on a page, that you end up with a laser and you end up having a page, that ending yellow dots on each page and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against the technology of us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, so a very, very much money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, -- <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their fortunes make their fortunes online, but they do it by the illegal media using the commercial <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy the key information to get information from our cards when we buy a computer.
The U.S. secret service -- two months ago, the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know their <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us who are a victim of a real <unk>
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most of the <unk> crimes on line.
The second group of <unk> <unk> that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, you motivate them, motivate them, motivate them, motivate them, motivate them to motivate them.
<unk> of groups like Anonymous -- over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the main <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the United government to <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government feeding against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
It takes the rise to the <unk>
And you get the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I asked him in a meeting with representative government meeting, he asked one of the Dutch leaders to get the death of the people who cause the death of the people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer was yes.
So what do people die from a heart of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services with <unk> services like <unk> services.
Except they <unk> a foreign authority.
And then <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened to the Arab Spring and those things have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt -- the <unk> protesters based on the Chinese secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those roles was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large-scale the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had been sold this tool for 6,000 euros the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, the Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to make themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to research the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, it's very obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going to be more there.
The connection to the Internet.
We were even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see the entire communication, and to hear the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this, the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it seems bad, but really not it doesn't affect me because I'm an honest <unk>
Why <unk>
I don't have anything to do that.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play privacy.
Happiness is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments in 2011, any right in 2011, any right in the time.
<unk> blindly in any future government in an management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, I live in Kenya, in the southern National Park.
These are cows in my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park.
The National Park has no fences in most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones who killed the night, and so soon we got to all over the morning and found it dead in the morning and we found it dead that I was very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land in order for <unk> and so we value them so that we value it so that we value it up.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
They were dying in warriors who protect our community and the cattle, and they're mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in National National Park.
A child in my community, at the age of nine to the livestock of his father and this was responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions were afraid.
But I realized that this is not actually <unk> because even helping lions see the pen <unk>
I don't think <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to <unk> the lions so I thought he was about <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and the second day, they got and said, this thing is not moving, and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that male lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to the turn that will turn the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell -- the load and battery and the <unk> battery to the tiny box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> they give up the outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's what lions do when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> to the lions so you think that I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have trouble with the lions.
And the neighborhood houses you have the idea.
One is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of the lions and the lions and asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to frightening predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using them to be diagnosed with <unk>
Thanks to this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, and I'm very excited. School, I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping us to raise funds, and so on.
It even took my friends to my community and put lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the meadows of the <unk> of the <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to fly flying planes and told me that one day would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to a aviation and a pilot and a pilot when they grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions in no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture the exciting thing to hear a story like you.
So you got a Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence to close power.
<unk> I know that it's already invented <unk> <unk> but I want to do the mine.
CA: You would have a time -- right, right, and you know, <unk> and you have tried -- I have tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> -- Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to <unk> on every step of my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a boy, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would go all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except America, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korean until everything changed in North Korea.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution first.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was not hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home to a letter from my sister.
That said, "When <unk> this, five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life on life on the street, holding a child in their arms looking at a child in their arms looking at the face of his mother and <unk>
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care and their families.
A huge famine goes to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North North America and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
It also became more and more frequent <unk> the energy cuts all around the night in the sea lights in the sea lights in the sea lights in the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea to this in the night in North Korea countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, he would see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went from North Korea, but I can only tell you that for the years of famine to this <unk> to live to China to live with.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family in China.
I had no idea of how life it would be like a <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but dangerous, because the North North North North America are also considered illegal immigrants because of illegal immigrants.
And so I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of back in North North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was made reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> to the police station.
Somebody had accused me, by being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language, and they made a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, and it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I was able to control my emotions for the <unk>
At the end of the <unk> he said to another official report. She was not <unk> she is <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America in China for <unk> <unk> <unk>
But many of you may be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though they were <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape down at many other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to travel my identity, I have decided to travel to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge, of what I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South and South America.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've become very different from 67 years from <unk>
I even went through a identity crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was not a country I could call <unk>
Even though it was going to life in South Korea -- I did not have a plan. I started to study for the exam for teaching college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities from North Korea to my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to the strength of the <unk> to the <unk>
They had to get them to immediately flee away.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to get it in a way, for more than three miles through China, and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> I took a week, and we were just caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by a police officer.
He asked them all the <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came to my family, she <unk> I stood up and told me and I told him that they were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards, guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month from a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to the embassy of South Korea to the South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, and desperately police station, desperately trying to release my family to my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
And at that moment, or the voice of a man, say, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger who would love to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, he was at the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and the two North North and <unk>
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the American people.
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to get more and more <unk> people.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people to <unk>
With time, after our long journey, my family and I went to South Korea and I went to South Korea.
But achieving its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of language, to work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans -- an opportunity to thrive international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the stage stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is <unk> stores of <unk> fast, fast <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought we are going to change the South Center for that it represents something else, so it represents something else, so they changed the South Los Angeles -- as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles  <unk> <unk> rapid food, fast land.
Like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a desert of food, the Los Center -- home and home to the <unk> of food and home to the car.
And the funny thing is that the places of food to get killed to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying from <unk> diseases in the South Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you had access to healthy food, and you see the <unk> you see the <unk> <unk> that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I think this must be stopped.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition to me to drive me out of a <unk> and I went back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> we call a <unk>
It's 45 me by <unk> three of me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me and I have to get my responsibility and I have to get it.
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, <unk> Green Green -- Green <unk> and we started to plant our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid paid group ahead of it made all of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything that we do is for free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone would be <unk>
The city I get on top of the city and in <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that he had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said to me, "Come on <unk>
A judicial enforcement for planting food on a piece of land that nobody would <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I was <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles from <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on Earth does not seem well like this?
We have a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar a <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
Do you get your own food is to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I'm going to be a part of this <unk> reality that it was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to <unk> my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
Such an artist <unk> which is that <unk> walls, and <unk> soils, -- <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> on that canvas.
You get to see what the earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You can't just imagine the amazing thing that is <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden witness an education witness to a transformation tool, in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
They were <unk> to see the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act.
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one day, he came a mother and his daughter, and they were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they were very <unk>
Now, man, I -- man, I felt bad that were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "My God is not afraid to get it to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you, but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave me their stories of how this had affected and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and was a fabulous to see how this changed, so just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If kids grow up, they are eating to eat them.
If they grow tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of these people are going to be told how the food affects the mind affects your mind and your body, you eat the blind food you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're caught. I see guys that are in this way designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to <unk> their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe we have the next next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do.
Now this is one of my agenda is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take shipping and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't <unk>
I'm not talking about free things, because the free it's not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try and work out to the guys on the street, to get the guys on the street, and the <unk> and the honor and the honor of growing its own food markets.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy things.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Would you take your <unk> <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me to sit comfortable in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- you probably all agree to agree with this is a very <unk>
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if they are <unk> on your bicycle and these cars go, it's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material that if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we wanted to want a silent <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt to <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use in most of the roads of the Netherlands, and the water can go through it, and the water can go through it, and you will have a road that it's easy to drive, and you will have a road that it's easy to drive, and not <unk>
Noise is also going to disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise to disappear, so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has some <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can be <unk>
What is it <unk> Look at this road by the <unk> <unk>
First of all, a stone, then and then -- and then -- and then -- and then -- you know, I won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> you're not going to be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see the damage in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of light, the <unk> this <unk> the <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you were <unk> and you will get off the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you will go through them, you get them here.
To solve this problem, we think about it <unk>
If we can make this material up, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the wool of steel in chunks of <unk> and we can mix those little pieces of pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt to <unk> little bits of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the ones you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk>
<unk> can warmth, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heating the steel, melt of the <unk> you will melt through these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I was using an iron oven. I can't bring the great machine machine here onstage.
<unk> <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take the sample, I'm going to get to see what happened.
This is the show that it comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
So we tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to do it."
So they gave us a bit of a road, 400 feet of the <unk> <unk> in which we had to make this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were making the test, and then of course, this road to last several years without damage. That's what we know of practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road, and we test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then the <unk> then we came back to it again.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, in closing, I can tell you that we made a material using the fibers of steel, bringing bringing these fibers, fibers, to actually increase the life of the surface surface of the road, to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and they can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, you have curiosity about if it also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to be cool in the first before I can show you before I can show you.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember I have woken up a morning with the sound sound of the <unk>
My father was listening BBC was listening in his small gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk> <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
He said, you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> of Afghanistan and they did illegal that the girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to get my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that two could be <unk>
Every day, we were just a different route that no one could suspect where you would <unk>
We had to hide the books on the market and the way we look like it shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our teacher, the students and our parents and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly came up for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan.
But my female mother became mastery.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our home home to school and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can leave your home for a war.
But there is one thing that always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to be going to do that.
So you still want not to be <unk>
I have 22 years today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find this proud to graduate in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home to the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carry it for the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I believe in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's why we <unk> the first and maybe the only private school school girls in Afghanistan, a country that is a risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, as the ones who, as the mine, and even in front of a opposition opposition, in spite of the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in a slums.
As a <unk> it's not your name, and I can't show you his face, but I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and his daughter were going to go from <unk> to his village, and they literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's the phone, a voice <unk> that if I was sending to the daughter to the school to the school to try.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but don't harm the future of my daughter in your old <unk>
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that it's often forgotten in the West, is that behind the most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, often are the first compelling <unk> the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school to be in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes are not very long at the bottom of the U.S. troops to be <unk>
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, I see the <unk> future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope, and for me, <unk> and every day girls the girls of the <unk>
Like me, they dream dream set.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never come back to a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent about two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> both from the <unk> revolution.
And a forces with many other citizens, within the country to call it <unk> and started a revolution against the <unk> regime and started a revolution against <unk> <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and women <unk> were in the <unk> they were in the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of dignity -- dignity and social justice.
Have you shown an entire courage to meet the brutal dictatorship <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> Middle East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months in the brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 trees and managed to <unk> our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the regime -- the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure of the culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've gotten to, along with many other women, rebuild the civil society society -- an inclusive transition toward democracy and just to democracy to democracy and the national reconciliation and the national reconciliation
It was about 200 of 200 organizations in <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I just started organizing workshops about the development of building and development skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- the <unk> leaders, the very <unk> women's leaders, to advocate to advocate to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right engaging in the construction of democracy and the peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
With time, our initiative was adopted and successful.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit of little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> all the days from violence.
One day I woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day he <unk> with the news of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day I woke up with the news of the murder of the army of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> of the human rights of the human rights and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, shaped by a <unk> mindset, the more, and it has been away from the ideal and the principles of freedom, dignity, of dignity, that that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to <unk> with our success story of the success story and the election.
I'm right here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose bad, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought the peace, the stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and <unk> and <unk> they brought that peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why are our society still continues to <unk> and dominated by politics with selfish policy and <unk> and so much for men like for their women for <unk>
Maybe what was missing is not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than I needed the election, that we just needed the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of the other female representation and <unk> of it.
We need to stop to act as agents of outrage and call to anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also putting it in practice practice expectancy in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are the ideals of a Libya, by the war, needs desperately with the end of the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which tries to <unk> and <unk> between the women's perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions that the word <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that spans of the all of the men and women, the people that all tribes and all the villages have <unk>
And so as the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all of existence.
That's what says, "My mercy is all the things."
That's what he says, "My mercy is <unk> on my <unk>
That all of you are going to make the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you to talk to you about a ridiculous question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the ones everyone make -- why she's left?
Why was somebody to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a <unk> and social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had had at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in the journal magazine.
I had my first <unk> my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secrecy.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> I was going to my head with a <unk> charged with bullets from <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, I put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap with love, where every year of women, and even some of millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be their story.
I don't look like a survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> at English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business School <unk>
I've spent the bulk of my career working for companies with <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Washington Washington, and the Washington Washington, and the Washington Washington Washington
I have almost 20 years later with my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all over and all the levels of income and their education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone think that domestic violence is that women in women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only is going on and <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place we want or we would expect to find <unk> reason for domestic abuse that domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would be left with a man who liked it and actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I had 22 years in the United States and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in the New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just from a college from the <unk> <unk> and he worked in a very important bank on Wall Street.
But what struck me most of that first I find was that it was ready and fun, and it was just a <unk>
I had great <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started to go out and loved everything of me <unk> which was ready, who had been at Harvard, to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> I believed in me as a writer and as a woman, as a woman, ever had ever done it.
And it was so that that <unk> in that school and the work on the Wall Street and the brilliant future had so much importance for it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any other relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York -- and I would leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so <unk> I quit my work and went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering their head in a physical trap and a psychological <unk>
The next step of domestic violence pattern is to introduce violence to see how they react it.
And this is where those weapons.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where you were supposed to <unk> I had to feel like you feeling three weapons.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in their pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to because of the trauma that lived in a small life.
I needed them to feel safe.
But these guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted my hand, my life, was in serious serious for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack happened was five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and they still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put my girlfriend from my mother and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that waiting for always, I loved for forever, because I loved it for a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a sense that it simply had a wedding for the <unk> and the fact that it was a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never would make me hurt.
I spent two times more in our <unk>
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back to the traffic moon, he was <unk> by the traffic and he threw me a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> he went down to <unk> one or twice for the next two years and in our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three Americans Americans are the victim of violence to the domestic of violence -- whether or at some point in their lifetime, and the Disease Control of the diseases that every year 15 million children are <unk>
So, in fact, I had very good company.
So let me go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
At the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us tackle their hell.
The other question that everybody else is doing is: Why don't you <unk>
Why don't I blame me, I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the most sad question and painful question people, because we came to the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in violence in domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of those in domestic violence in cases happen after the victim of the end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent harassment even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, and the manipulation of the family justice system to <unk> the victim of the family and their children, who often are forced by judges not with the man to spend their mother.
And so we still keep asking why they're not going to.
I was able to go to the end, I was able to go from one last <unk> to go off my denial.
I realized that man I loved that I would have killed if he would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world: to the police, my neighbors, my friends, the entire strangers, and I'm here today because all of you here today because you all <unk> me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the <unk> women -- women -- <unk> the <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say "The guilt is -- is yours -- it is -- because the victims of the <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> I've heard -- I've heard hundreds of stories and women who also come to who learned a lesson from what happened to what happened to their life and to make their lives, their joyful lives and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I really am a victim and a survivor of domestic violence, very typical of a very typical <unk>
I went to marry a cute man and kind of kind of <unk>
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to get back to have never even more, it's an <unk> gun pointing to my head from someone who says I will.
At this moment, just like you're thinking, "Oh, that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid things, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, at his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> <unk> the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Life thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light into it.
We need the victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the light by talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family friends.
<unk> their vision of the survivors of fantastic survivors and <unk> that have a future <unk>
You know, the external signs of violence to intervene consciously, to get away from their climb and show to the victims of the safe and show the victims of the safe <unk>
Together, we can convert our beds, and our tables and our families in the <unk> and our families should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a little tension in the room because I should not have myself dressed in my way --  -- luckily, I brought them to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing in a <unk> so you have a lot of a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of changing what you think about it 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
They are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to be used to.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater by your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so I don't do anything as long as my mind.
All right.
Why did I've done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not so much like this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but we also <unk>
I have totally changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer he said to me and he said to me that he was going to get the hair back to the girl hair.
Of course, except with surgery, or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little things to do to transform our way, which, even though superficial and <unk> and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I am a nice woman and white, and in my work, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it to be model?
And I'm always discovered, <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason why I made me model is because I won the genetics lottery and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and you are wondering what is this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries not only have defined beauty as health, and symmetry and symmetry and what we're biologically programmed to, for <unk> also that we have associated with a <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now <unk> and perhaps some of the <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> -- there are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so many models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City, all of the models and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> it is just about four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can I be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take it from that.
But then what I would tell each one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and <unk> which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If we after this two spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, I say, "I know I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or <unk> or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be higher.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate to you all the things I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery can be summed up.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have already taken your studies, and you have a demo and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to -- I mean, if you <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but you have a little bit weird.
The next question that people always do me is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, there is virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I told me and also the first time he used to me, and I didn't even have my period. It wasn't even my period.
I know we're moving into a personal field, but it was a girl.
So it was just this next a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> feast a few days before the French photos for French <unk>
Here I am with a football team and in the Queensland magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a professional group of <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of his <unk> and <unk> and get to create this. That's not me. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: I mean, do things for for me to <unk>
I have too too many <unk> who have never use, except the couple of previous things, but the privilege that I get are the ones I get in the real life, and what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and he forgot to bring me money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend in red <unk> and he jumped into a red light <unk> and of course, <unk> and <unk> -- I'm sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- because of my way, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying to pay a price for whatever they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> were black and <unk> were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men and Latino young in New York, so for them, is not a matter of <unk> <unk>
How many times do I know about how many times I want.
When I research for this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States, they don't like their body, and that figure out to 78 percent in the 17.
So the last question people ask me is: How do life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin hair, you will feel <unk> you will feel very happy and feel beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can see it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also amazing to be able to work with creative and smart and <unk>
And that's the way, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, I'm <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my every day.
And if you ever ask you some more thin legs and the brightest hair, you will be happier?
You only have to meet with a group of models, because you have the most <unk> legs and clothing and <unk> women are physically the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender and gender when I was one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that retain from this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable with the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and of the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough enough to keep a camera, but I want to share with you with my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't get them to the <unk>
There were no directors, directors or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum in the lighting.
In fact, most of them all over tourists tourists at random.
My story begins when I went to a city of New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me out of this photo holding my daughter in the day to his first birthday. That is the corner of the 57 and <unk> corner.
I happen to that I happen to New York -- just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday birthday birthday -- my wife told me, why don't you get me to <unk> in New York on a <unk> <unk>
This is when we started asking to the tourists that were going to get us out of the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering to the camera to a complete unknown <unk> to be so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much the life would change this journey.
It became sacred something sacred to us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day girl girl, he could understand.
These pictures are a lot more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's a way to stop the time in a last week, and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our daughter changes, my daughter reaches into new <unk> and I can see the lives through the eyes and how to see and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion all the year.
And recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when we suddenly have a dry <unk> and he pointed out to a red <unk> <unk> that was a little bit of a <unk>
And I described to me what it felt for the five years in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you see in New York is universities, because he's determined to study in New York City.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we created are the memories.
So, I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I didn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the guy who gets the photo.
Today I want to encourage you to all of you to come up in the picture, and do it, you get out to come up with somebody and asked him a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group of birds.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs in the <unk> laughter as stupid characters.
More recently, if you have been following the <unk> press <unk> laughter, and I applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with <unk> but I don't accept it.
"I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not running clean the environment.  <unk> they don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They are hardly <unk>    And so my favorite, the <unk> <unk> you have better presence.   And there are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are primarily in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> and the World <unk> where we have 16 species of 16, with a high risk of extinction.
So why <unk> are important important, and first of all, they provide physical services <unk>
They're the <unk> of the natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that would not be <unk> and caused huge losses from livestock and diseases into other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there is no <unk> the carcasses are three to four times in <unk> and this has enormous ramifications of disease.
<unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and with <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and the decline in Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Atlantic <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they make very important to open the open sky, in places like Tibet, -- there is no place to bury the dead dead or wood wood or wood wood so that these <unk> provide their natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are in extreme <unk>
The reason why they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities -- they use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> of extinction, who means that in less than 10 or 15 or 15 years -- they fall out of the livestock of livestock that have been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use vet in India and they've taken a look at India and have taken place.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs -- in landfills and when you have dogs dogs have a huge bomb bomb in <unk> The number of case of anger has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> -- they're going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines would do this to the birds. It was all the birds.
They are <unk>
In Western West -- there is a horrible trade trade.
So what are you doing? Well, we're now researching these birds. We are researching <unk>
We're trying to determine the basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so we can focus on an ongoing problem for nothing.
We have to work with government at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking with them about appreciating the <unk> of these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can you help? Can you become assets, and you can tell them to tell you about these very <unk> creatures, and we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you will talk about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw the <unk> he saw <unk> without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, to be much poorer with these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do and everything I do -- my life -- it's been <unk> <unk> for seven years in Africa.
<unk> from <unk> to <unk> until I was young, I worked in Zambia, Kenya, in Zambia. of <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa is <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of all of that, everything you would get out of it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a Italians where we decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach local tomatoes and Italians and we teach the local tomatoes -- Italians and <unk> and <unk> ...
Of course, people were not at all who were at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they were in as many of the local people in so fertile --  -- we know, as the local people, in such fertile fertile valley, were not had to have agriculture.
However, instead of asking you to do how it was possible to do anything, we simply said, "Thank God you are here."  We were in time to save the people that are here."
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> to this size.
And we couldn't believe we were saying them, we were telling them, "Look how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red in the morning -- about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, <unk> my God, the God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."   "Why don't you <unk> you have never <unk>
I thought only we have the Italians -- I thought that only us in the <unk> but then I saw what the Americans, and then then to see what the Americans, and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You see the <unk> <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or are <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin words from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with anyone from a different culture -- like my children, I want to be a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the culture of a different culture, like my <unk>
So the white ones in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face, <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, whether people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This is the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference on the ground put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have the 27 years of just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you would never make any one, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do this? You get <unk>
You can never get to one community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important.
And so we help them find the knowledge of the fact that no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea you may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years and years back, I had this idea: why not us, for once instead of coming to a community to tell people what to do, for a time, I would tell them not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they have been <unk>
So the planning has this blind thing to blind in.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know about them -- because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do do? We work one to one, and we work face your face -- you have to create social infrastructure, you have to create a social infrastructure.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family for the family of the company, the family family, the family family doctor in business, which is to you in their house, in the coffee, and they find it to find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away away from this <unk> garbage in which we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government and the government to see asking, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did a very, very, very, very hard.
And I was <unk> and <unk> --  So the government says, <unk> <unk> --  -- we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most dramatic business spends the history of the history of the story, passed to '96, ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy teacher before to get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the death of the business <unk>
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what most people are in <unk> they want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you to privacy, you have to be fantastic <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What do you have more <unk> more this tomorrow?
Local people <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you, the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> the fossil revolution, and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies for it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
It will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it right now.
There is a beautiful story that on a journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the <unk> he got together, this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York City, there was not about 100 years from the New York City, there was not about 100 years old.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing into this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure is produced by six million horses.
They were already <unk> they were <unk> so in <unk> and so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology of New York City.
So what happens? It's the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States, the United States came to the United States -- <unk> manufacturers were.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in places in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to working with the entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you."
Otherwise they're not going to come with you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then I will have to tell you the truth is to tell you about <unk>
The youngest company, the larger company -- has to be able to do three things <unk> the product that you want to sell you -- you have to be fantastic, and you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world I can be able to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We've looked at and looked at 100 companies from the <unk> world, <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies -- <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, only one person was started by a single person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He was not just when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> and in <unk> in bars with their youth <unk> who will be for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> someone who speaks to you, to you, what will you think?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can be <unk> Can you look for <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why I don't change much knowledge despite the fact of the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects emerged from questions like, how much people pay my neighbors for your <unk>
How can we pay for <unk> to borrow more things without calling the door to a <unk>
How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better than our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for the cows you can reflect so that our communities can reflect our communities today.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give a shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city and I trust a city and I trust a city in a city.
It's always going to go to the music.  There's a name in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one of the most abandoned properties of the United States.
I live near this house, and I thought it could turn it into a pleasant space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and the death and so much.
And this is a deep thing that made me deep gratitude for the living time.
He gave the clarity to the very important things of my life.
But let's get to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to go to catch up on day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of the new friends and new friends that the wall of this home -- on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk>
So the <unk> could make a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to have this experiment but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before die I would die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I die, I want to die to sit on the line of <unk>
Before die I would die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die. I want to die again, again, more."
Before die I would die I want to go from <unk>
Before dying I would die I want to be completely myself."
This space has become <unk> and dreams and dreams and hope of people laughing to <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that one is not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways -- this is trying to support the reflection and <unk> and remember what is the most important thing to us as we grow and we change and we change it.
This happened last year and I started to receive hundreds of messages of people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center of the civic center we made a kit and have the walls in the countries around the world, like <unk> South Australia, and Argentina and so beyond.
And together, we will show the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of rates. It's more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective of the way and remember that life is very rare.
<unk> is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that I understood that to death is one of those things that are more power.
We think about the death of the <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as community and more and more media and people, people around us, not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
And I don't talk about, but it transmits better joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what the love.
It is <unk> it happens to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice it doesn't matter the religious <unk>
When I singing to songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words that I didn't even think of the mind that we know about the mind and the wonderful thing to be the unknown.
Samuel it's 16 years old. It's a very <unk> <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we said, when I was four years old, I got to get in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk>
You don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not <unk> to the concept of <unk> of society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if you don't consider them within it, even if you don't consider them within it, that just might mean one thing: that would be <unk> <unk> and some extraordinary <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, as learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In every single individual in the different form of the different way, that <unk> is so different at Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, we will be diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development that faster in the world, faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, didn't really seem very interested in me at all.
I was living and lived in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in a row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and to eat anything that was in the <unk>
As I was growing up, and the differences became more different, and the differences were made <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity line -- there was something really struck by the pure nature of a human and innocent, a child who would see the world without boxes, a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments when they wish it to be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have been taught about individuality, and the love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by the beauty of the differences that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could put it a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have normal to be normal.
They may be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us have a gift in their interior, the quest for normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for it, the progress and the change is dies in the moment that we try to be the others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced it to be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
Penn State State University I was asked to give a class of communication to students of engineering.
I was afraid.  <unk> of real <unk> of these students with their great minds their great books and their great books and great words.
But in the developed of those conversations, I felt what I had to have felt when he fell through the hole of the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience it as well.
And I think the key thing to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers at the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges in the health care and if we don't know that we don't understand it, and we don't understand how we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we didn't have a scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, for the engineers, please, with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do to make sure that your science is sexy to make sure that your science is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply studying the <unk> but you study <unk> which are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and <unk>
And when you're describing the science, your science with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> that is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them dumb dumb thing.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They're ways to be used and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why are they called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> <unk> kill and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain in our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, shows that that special structure of the <unk> is so strong that really inspired design of the only <unk> <unk>
So the trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then it will give you a little deeper sense of your other and you create a deeper sense of understanding of what you get.
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and look at the country and see the country of wonders and science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all the media, from all the media, the <unk>  Thank you.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor in the 19th century that defined a much better when he said, "A <unk> is that it looks for a public with no matter or the <unk> platform, or the beginning, and then when I gained it as a monumental of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something you see with the words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are being the base of politics, and that all the politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words the exact words <unk>
And all this was because of a guy in a guy with the rare name -- <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put it in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end had a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded sentence of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> as this <unk>
Most people think it is <unk>
It's not. It's a freedom of expression.
But to show you to actually show you the words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They got all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> from the <unk> State and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and the other <unk> of the U.S. America.
Not <unk>
Some of you simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by an effective term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired and <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks.
I read the daily <unk> and he always said, "It's always about this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the Kansas House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives -- I didn't want Washington to <unk>
They didn't want to call him if he was giving him or to their publisher, but to their careers.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> <unk> more <unk> and <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. It had before, but only it meant before you <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> with little <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> was really a <unk>
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and met with <unk> <unk>
"And who do it seriously with a title and <unk> as President as President of the <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, and this is my favorite, the Senate until I came out, the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that as a government is <unk>  <unk> you can keep going to <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you about it is that the title of the United States of America doesn't sound just so modest today, right?
If you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads are more than 5,000 nuclear economy in the world and a fleet of air aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story of the <unk> of the <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
You get his title for <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, <unk> appearance -- well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations now you have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the kind of the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to be going to feel humble when you say you are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to be <unk>
So politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but actually actually the change -- really but really, really changing the words far more than the words that could change the reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in an illegal <unk>
The air is <unk> and dust and <unk> and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> men and <unk> and <unk> with <unk> tools.
Like others, I carry it on a cheap light flashlight on your head with your head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> of that hole from a meter that falling hundreds of feet on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met the control and dropped countless feet in that <unk>
While I talk to you today, these men are in the deep top of that hole in their lives, their lives without pay and reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home to the <unk> but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I've been documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Mexican <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> a NGO that that has to eradicate the modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew it about slavery because I knew that there was in the world.
When we end up talking to me, I felt very sad, honestly and ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer to my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
Sometimes I was even considered my second home.
But this time, we were <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there is more than 27 million people in <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much as the most displaced Africans during the whole tries for the whole <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> of the <unk>
However, today you can teach entire families for entire generations for 18 percent by 18 feet from 18 percent.
Amazingly, slavery makes slavery generates over 13 billion dollars a year in the entire world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises for good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, violence cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
slavery exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I knew the bricks.
This strange show and formidable was like entering ancient Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, kids, in fact, all the entire families in the entire families -- and the <unk> and they take them out of the blast to the <unk> and the lead the blast furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for about 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no help to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> it was made to make it pee for severe <unk>
As <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, thinking, my camera is getting a lot better than these people.
Back in the blast in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was going to quickly grabbed me and said to me, <unk> don't do you here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not civil in that country.
I could put it in a situation worse than they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system by their liberation and he trusted it to be <unk>
As I waited to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids wear rocks for mile for <unk>
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who get them to their heads <unk> made by <unk> <unk> made of <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing with what <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> their <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness I told me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
I had led me by a few stairs who gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known as the craft, they're local for prostitution to <unk>
They have small, small, private rooms, <unk> with their girls and kids, some of them as only seven years -- they're forced to buy more food and <unk> to the <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and at that point, I could barely imagine that I could imagine what is supposed to be caught in <unk> in that hell.
He just had a <unk> the stairs where they were <unk>
There was no door <unk>
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, if you touch a subject so difficult -- it is important to point that slavery -- even sexual trafficking, the sex trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are born in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times was reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year like sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families who had entire families in the silk trade.
This is a portrait of family.
The black hands black hands are the father, the blue <unk> and the red and the blue hands of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope yet to go out of this house someday and go to another day where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake -- the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we come, I went to a look fast.
I saw what it seemed like a fishermen in a boat -- two older brothers -- some young kids, make sense of the younger kids, it makes sense of it.
They were <unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, they have been forced to work in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with a little bit of the way that your boat was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of <unk>
And the branches of the trees -- the trees in the trees are often based on <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and with fear, they get to water to unlock the branches.
Most of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love he's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> tries to younger slaves under their clothes.
I met these guys at the five o'clock in the morning, when they were born, the latest networks, but they had been working from the one of the course of the time.
On the night and <unk>
And it fits that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
They went through a road in Ghana with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and the window.
We were asked to get it through a land road to the forest.
At the end of the track, we would get me out of the car, and he asked the driver that went out very quickly.
Then he pointed this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed from the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way I was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team out of the <unk> to the chest of the head to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in of course, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit into a football field that could fit in a football camp and they were all full of their workers.
A lot of women had kids tied to their backs and they were looking for gold, <unk> in the water <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners who are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well when they came out of their own <unk>
I remember he looked at his eyes <unk> <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
So the wells have to 90 feet of these people up to a heavy rock and they will get to another area in which the stone <unk> to be able to get the gold.
When you first see the site it seems like to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closely closely, the margin we see the other <unk>
They're all the victims of diseases and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this <unk> victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying of your uncle, <unk> I was with the debt of the uncle what it force to be in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the 14 years and injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors say it must be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and it has T.B. to work at night and that this mine.
Yet, he dream of being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote deal.
I want to throw light over the slavery.
Did you know their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted to know that you knew that we will be testimony of them and we will do everything to help change their lives.
<unk> I believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to see each other like the slavery.
These images are not from magazine -- it's from people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that happens to me that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, that I've had the great honor to meet.
So I hope these images wake up a force where you see them -- people like you, and I hope that force turn on a fire and that fire <unk> light over the slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematics math and there is a particular problem that we <unk> we are like <unk> we are like <unk>
No one knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and explain to you today to try to explain what I do.
dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  to see the <unk> going on.
But <unk> demand for extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity -- and probably a certain <unk> <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous <unk>
Over the last few years have been made in treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way that we will know if there's a cure to be when we have an objective metric and you have an objective metric and you're going to be <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement and other disorders of the blood and the best thing we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials are never done.
What if patients could do it in home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam have to make them make ourselves?
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to tell you -- as a matter is not the conventional wisdom to a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> <unk>
It shows someone healthy that it makes a sound of a sounds of the sounds of talking about, we can imagine as a dancers of vocal vocal because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sound and all of the genes needed.
And as the did they have an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
You can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
The neurological test isn't <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design to a whole range of hospitals to do it.
They are both accurate. Well, they are both accurate.
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take 30 seconds out of 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it turns into massive scale.
So these are some incredible goals that are <unk>
We can reduce the food difficulties from patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for <unk>
With <unk> we could often get goals.
We could make a massive <unk> at the cost of clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> Initiative of Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world in the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or <unk> he can call it at low price and leaving recordings for a cents. And I'm happy to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you can say who is healthy -- you can say who's healthy and who not?
What are these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or no disease.
You see, some people may not buy it, some people may not buy it.
But we're going to get a very big sample data in different circumstances, and it will do it in different circumstances, it's very important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in a search for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of precision at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job, and now has shown now that it works in a mobile phone and then it has shown to the project. We have a 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the darkness, and with no windows and, typically, we avoid the solar light.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the impossible, and we would be able to care in the press all the time, but some of us really are artists and a real taste of talent and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, the 2011, I saw the rest of the world, just like the rest of the world, <unk> events that were in Japan.
Shortly time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
This is a little of the act of fishermen in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level level <unk> over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools, we removed the slime houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons and tons of dead fish -- dead fish.
We were <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors are found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and <unk> and <unk>
They all made the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the village around for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that that people had <unk>
As he was fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> <unk> the enormous, giant giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the <unk> and I had the honor of that day to be <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I'd heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go back to my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of them had more than a hundred years old, they were still in the lab, to think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and he knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I came up with Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and I knew that I had to try.
So we started repairing the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do it with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as it would be as tragic <unk>
With the end of the time, they came for a little bit more of the time, and they got more <unk> so he went back to Facebook and five days later -- 80 people from 12 days volunteered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got us to <unk> a village neighbor to the North <unk>
Once we use the week we use our scanner in all the time the time the people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time the time <unk> it is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could be an hour. I could be a few weeks ago.
I could make a few months.
This <unk> he had to draw <unk> by hand using the areas whose color areas and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures long, covered in bacteria, with algae with algae, and even with the oil, and it was all over the course of the course of time, and I continue to get out of that <unk>
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it was clean, dry and it would have been <unk> for his <unk>
We had kind of <unk> by hand.
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy harm even more to the photos already <unk>
As once he said, the leader of my group is like to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had kind of kind of relationship to the photos.
I had started to <unk> her same but stopped realizing that they were <unk> even more.
I had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face wouldn't have been able to <unk> the images in a single photo -- and we were able to cut the whole picture.
When he collected their photos shared pictures of their history with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures at a fire station, between the rubble station, between the rubble -- pretty far away from where your colleagues would be <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to closing the barriers to the wave, to the wave, to the <unk>
He had to go inside the water <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in the high schools.
One of them was caught in water.
He took him a week to find his family and found that they had everyone survived.
The day I gave him his photos her younger son, <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look back to look, something that could be taken to look at, which would not have been marked by that day in his life changed when everything in his life changed.
After six months in Japan that had been joined in, hundreds of they had hundreds of them met to hand out more than 75,000 photographs -- the great <unk> of the great <unk> of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from all over the world helped us to bring back to 90 families back to the whole world hundreds of young photos and <unk> them.
For this time, we don't really spend over a thousand dollars in teams and materials, most of the ink in ink and so most ink in the ink in it.
We took pictures all the time.
One photo is a memory for someone or something, a relationship, a relationship, a message.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would get to us, but the first thing we want to look for.
And this was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring to someone to their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is someone like this one is a huge difference in the life of the person to do.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, to bring back something, using their talent to something that aren't thin models of perfect skin.
So I would end up I'd like to read this email from the day I went back to the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While we were <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from grandmother, to the grandmother to a little baby, to my family, because a very similar picture of my family family -- and my mother and <unk> me and my <unk> daughter standing out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all our very few basic needs -- right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition in an exhibition in one of an apple <unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go for a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion frames of a second.
I introduce you to a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technical technique that can make video in a slow camera that can make video in motion.
And with that, we can create the cameras that you can see after the bottom line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and the <unk> of the <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and switch on it, and it turns out and it turns out in a <unk> of a second or it -- to create a <unk> package of photons just a millimeter <unk>
And this package of photons, <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet a <unk>
If we take that bullet and <unk> package of photons and tag on this bottle, how they disperse that photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of the <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this is happening in less than a <unk> it's what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things on this <unk> <unk> this information is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a photons and <unk> it starts to <unk> and that, inside <unk>
Part of the light is going to the table, it's going to the table, and we start seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there is a air bubble bubble.
At that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the reflections of the top you see in the background of the bottle, after several boxes, that the students' <unk>
Now, if we take a shot and ordinary current and we do it in a slow <unk> and we see it in a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much think it would take us to sit down to that film?
One day? A week?
It would be a very boring film --  from a slow bullet on motion.
And how about testing nature of <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table, the tomato <unk>
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought that nature is a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> <unk>
But if you look at it once more and more of this tomato <unk> you'll notice that as light comes <unk> you are not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato sauce is <unk> and light bounces into your interior, and it goes out of various <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket.
Why do we create this camera in <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo at a low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I can barely get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> <unk> million times, and we recorded one and we recorded and over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> and <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes, they can become invisible, other heroes.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You can go into the room, you're going to go into the room, you go into the room, a part that's going to reflect on the door, and from the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction -- it's already <unk>
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons going to go back to the camera -- but interestingly, it's slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique powers.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door to the <unk> and we know that to the <unk> but we don't know what point corresponds to what it is.
So when you project a laser you can record a picture in <unk> which you see on the screen, it really doesn't have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, <unk> and try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, you can see the <unk> object.
Can we see <unk>
This is our reconstruction up.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> and <unk> with what is going to the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors of dangerous conditions by looking at light windows by looking open windows.
Or we could build <unk> could be able to see inside the body by the body <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is a very difficult order to the scientists that start to think of <unk> as a new <unk> in order to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> he turned science science -- an art in art, an art of photographs of pictures.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect each time are not just for a scientific visualization, but we can have no longer just for scientific <unk>
We create a new form of computer photography and a slow camera and color code.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, time between each of those waves of those waves is just a few <unk>
But this is something that also happens.
If we look at waves under the <unk> these are moving from us.
The waves should move toward us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have strange to see this image.
The order for the events in the world to sometimes appear to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can be <unk> life, and gives you freedom.
With a mobile phone you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message in Egypt. in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This is all possible for a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change.
This is now the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered that look for a change, they had a mobile pocket.
Who from <unk> have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile mobile phones.
<unk> One Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's pretty much all a mobile phone today.
But I'm going to talk about me today about my mobile, and how to my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 thousand lines of information.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every telephone company company, every day of Europe of Europe has to store a wide range of information has to store the users of users.
Who's called <unk> Who sends an email to the <unk>
Who sends text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where are we are.
All this information is out at least six months, and to two years old, in their telephone company or their Internet <unk>
And in the entire Europe -- people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people that came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany was <unk>
And I also asked myself if this really works.
You can store all this information on us?
Every time you use your mobile faces.
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that then it was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to wonder, and I didn't have a concrete <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to have a court for me, because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, I would have a deal.
They get the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Veterans' Court failed to <unk> the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little on brown <unk>
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a time I realized it is my life.
There's six months in my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, "I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So next to the <unk> <unk> and the Open of India, we did this.
This is a six months in my life.
You can zoom in and you can go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk to me a couple of times.
Then they call me a few friends and they call me each other.
And then you call the other, and we ended up with this great <unk> and we ended up with this great communication network.
You can see how their people communicates each other to what time they call each other, they sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who is talking to whom, you send an email to whom all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is <unk> at least six months in Europe, and to two years old.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989, they had a mobile pocket.
And <unk> I would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if I knew it, I would have known as the leaders, this never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information is possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility to keep our lives and do it forever.
But <unk> and live in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight the <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When you come home home to your friends, your privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not just fashion.
When you go home, you go back to their representative of that because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information can you store about your phone <unk>
So in the future, every time they use their mobile phones to remind them to remember they have to fight on the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi <unk> what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why I read all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
No one who was <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents would be prime kids, including it.
It's just a accidents, of accidents, as I came to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not an inspiration.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be a disabled <unk>
Let's go on.
Christmas Christmas is in the commercial center, they drive in circles to look for parking and looking for parking <unk> and what they see?
16 empty places for a <unk>
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I've got 99 problems, and P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian <unk> woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't have that feel better, maybe you should do that.
I'm from Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that that my neighborhood, my neighborhood and my disease had the same content.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I do.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters bigger sisters and I <unk>
If my three sisters went to school, my parents went to the public school, and he was <unk> that I also knew -- and if we didn't get all the ultimate note the ultimate note -- the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another procedure that I used was to hang out a dollar in front of me to get it.
The <unk> that I carry it was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten he was walking like a letter that he has gotten a lot of <unk> who have received many <unk>
We had only six Arabs were in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab -- and they are still all of the family --  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate the politicians would use <unk> to the <unk>
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that he had enough fat to live three months -- so <unk> all of the <unk> at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, and so they sent me to the school school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I learned to dance with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends went to the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going to come.
I was going through my summers in a war, because my parents were afraid that if not come back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get out in <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back to my back, <unk> in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I think <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before we do yoga it was a comedian -- it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can do it in your head.
My parents, my parents who could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the <unk> University of the Arizona, because he walked in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the <unk> of the least smart, I took them the maximum note back in my age, too.
Every time I did a scene of the glass of the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a <unk> <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started shouting at the four <unk> I started to have a <unk>
I have learned <unk>
At the end of the end, he ended up <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end of my <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  I got it to <unk> Brown.
I went to the head of the theater, and I went to the head of the theater, to ask me why and she would have killed me because they believe my cat, and he told me that because they believed me that I could do the stunts for risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts for risk, you can't do <unk>
It was a paper that he literally had been born and they gave him to an <unk> no cerebral palsy, they gave him to a cerebral <unk>
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disability actors for <unk>
At the age I went home to home, and my first tour, <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see more than the <unk> and it was clear for me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors with disability.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the ruler.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made me <unk>
At my first tour, I took him from famous famous from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first one he was going to the <unk> that he was at high speed speed by the highway <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in South Carolina all of the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle States, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says that women are not fun, and they're very fun.
In 2003, my brother brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Doha and I launched the <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his <unk>
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and instead remind you to <unk> <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fight against the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the cable news, the cable news program, with Keith <unk>
I went to a college dance if I went to a college dance to a study and sat me on a <unk>
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and he said, <unk> four, three, three <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I taped me to the desk desk in the front of not going to go off the screen during the <unk> and when I ended the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> knew they wouldn't get me to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just <unk> and shut my chair.
One fun thing I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me or even a girl or even bigger.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became the object of <unk>
I would see online clips with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease.
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested that I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is as visual as the race.
If you're in a wheelchair you can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
The disabled, are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
And the doctors say they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I had grown with the media, I don't think that <unk> I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images from the disability and in the daily lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images, it might be less <unk> on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the entire society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk> and the infamous <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> at the whole state of New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started <unk> the children of <unk> a charity to give <unk> to Palestinians refugees.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> on peace, <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young child of a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little village in the <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the <unk> to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes to there, there is no opportunities, there's no work, no perspectives in the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he has a man who offers it to take him to <unk> after for dinner, to <unk>
He meets dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
She gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home to their family.
They show a young lady.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, a bomb.
That child in that little village with dreams of the great city of the great city -- and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to the <unk>
So how do the story of a young child of a young people trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for a chance, waiting to start your future, waiting a perspective, and this was the first thing to arrived.
And this was the first thing that got it out of what we call the <unk>
And his story is on urban centers on urban centers.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk>
For the young people, the city promise -- the great sleep dream is the opportunity for jobs, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of <unk>
By 2030, three of five in five people living in the cities are under 18 to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't include them opportunities, the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, and to the <unk> to be the story of the cities to be the history of our cities.
And in my city of birth, 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent is not working at school.
They do not do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to <unk> Hospital.
I remember to be in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and I would never have gone?
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was at <unk> that month was actually the way to support a few young leaders in a business price.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders to <unk>
We sat down and had a rain rain of ideas on the solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was <unk> at the University of <unk>
I had no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said when he was a graduate graduate college college was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to the point B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war, they have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
He saw an opportunity and he saw <unk>
He started a company.
He started <unk> to the local residents to the local residents who typically couldn't afford to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is at some of the time expanding over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think your ability to identify and make a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> the young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so hard.
And you can train the young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how it will be innovative and how to make a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until Mohamed until Mohamed who wanted me to, if you wanted your flowers for your <unk> We were from plastic from the abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers in <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw a chance.
He started a company from <unk> and <unk>
He created a farm in outside of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could it survive hard to <unk>
And it started the flowers of flowers to <unk> creating gardens in the houses, and the city, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park -- in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO working working for government, but their innovation, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be businesspeople, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They run business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to do it in development and they need to make their businesses.
We are going to the young people with the resources that need them to make the support that need to go from conception to the creation of the creation of which and to create real <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from street to to help rent to rent for <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their innovation innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> in the northern the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the <unk> leaves like a <unk> and not be on the way that we can find that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a <unk> in <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls.
And I was <unk> and I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought they thought was going to clean <unk>
That question followed with me, and he was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you are, the <unk> the <unk> your trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> at the reason of 11 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know how individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked in the trucks and I interviewed people in office and I went back to the entire city, and I learned a lot of the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed more.
So I started to work out like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And the <unk> mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It is there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still going to <unk> the weight of bringing about their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau Office of <unk> <unk> is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the most dangerous <unk>
You're coming out and moving into traffic all the day and walk around around you.
They just want to <unk> so that in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall in the truck and cause terrible harm and terrible damage to the <unk>
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back to the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's as a form of breathing or <unk>
It must always be on motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective and every day, this starts to move from your container and your dangers inherent us in very real ways.
Disease we had for decades and for decades, and they start <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the motors of the economy start to fail when you're in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for the capitalism, just at the <unk> I am not advocating at the end of their relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed rate.
I mean by just the speed that we used to move to and <unk>
We usually don't have any <unk> or <unk> and we are with us with our coffee cup of coffee, our water <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will be to it.
So today I want to suggest to a couple of ways to think about the waste collection that maybe will help reduce the stigma and engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every single day every single day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to make us.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of <unk> on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey on paper and had all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that I started to research <unk> and I went back to the <unk>
It's called <unk> and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist in this planet as we have to include and having to account for all the costs, even the costs we have to include and have to have on the account for the work of the <unk>
The city waste that we think when we talk about garbage, you represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next thing you see someone whose work is to clean up the junk for you, take a moment for you.
Let me give you a moment to tell you much.
My work is focused on thinking of our community thinking about our community life that is part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I have two recent projects today like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other one in Tunisia.
They're also sharing the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping mall, in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as the <unk> of my team and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty buildings because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because of the boundary with crystals heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's about a weather of 20 to 25 degrees from 20 to 25 degrees in the entire year.
And thirdly, what does it do not have anything to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old air structure that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
And so I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building in the building of several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge I presented to the <unk> the site, the site, which is located in a much growth area in the city, where most of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist.
And in addition to two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the inputs in the building.
And it spreads into an <unk> <unk> that creates a space that creates a space that is <unk> in the building and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor in the ground form.
I also thought, how can we close the building?
I wanted to find a solution to that <unk> to the local local conditions.
And I started to think about a similar fabric tissue to a concrete concrete with <unk> to allow the input of the air and also the light, but in a <unk>
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and it helped me to model it.
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way that just controlled inside the air in the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It's not a mall.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was so much more profitable than the commercial center, because in order of the end of the mall in the end there was more local to themselves.
And the idea of the facade was so much more economic -- not just because of the material compared with the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city in the city that the electricity is in the middle almost every day.
So we get a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas and <unk> that would create the <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, in the roof, collect water for the <unk>
It is expected for the earlier next year, because we go through the fifth base floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project that is so big, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to just understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I was special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure years that was surrounded by a wall of a years of access to <unk> <unk> with the connected access to a connected <unk>
When I went to the place, the first of the design operation, which we did was to expand the existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks and the characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some points of <unk> in relation with the idea of the gates <unk> with straight lines, and this altered model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell cell -- as an apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and so much natural ventilation <unk>
So they <unk> a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European building and the Arab city and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms to make a higher density at higher levels and lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is about to give to the community the space <unk>
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get <unk> and make activities, and make such activities, like run a <unk>
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where we can see the cities are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and the local economies of the world are changing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important and looking for the architecture for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to be able to connect the nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was so remarkable, like you see all the new girls.
I had very big hair, very brilliant piles of hair, a little <unk> of cute <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the state of the <unk> very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the <unk> and I hid in the <unk> <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my <unk>
And then I did.
I put the ratings out of my <unk> just a little bit, just just like this.
All the Like --  And I had I set back to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my colleagues had very good notes too.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them to the <unk> and I put a row out of <unk> and I just got a row out there.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I don't understand why I was <unk>
It's that it was all obvious that it was obvious to it.
I never was <unk>
But above all, I would tell me, the reason why I bothered to this -- so small -- so small, just to <unk>
And I'm going to get the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that look at traffic, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so we have to go to the fiction, because of the lab that you study <unk> you are like the lab in all its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk> there would be no <unk>
There would be no <unk> king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I was going to the cooking lists of high school because because we would be missing "The <unk> and <unk> we would not have <unk> and <unk> us from <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and for the <unk> I almost have them all over the <unk>
This year is 100 years from their <unk> <unk> "In the most <unk> of the <unk> the most <unk> of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of <unk> right?
We think a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about the relentless <unk>
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were so hard as a cat.
I don't know how it's <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well to see why they're going so well and <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the <unk> who gets to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being at the <unk> you can see exactly the <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> <unk> right?
The <unk> do we do all of these <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure to the other, maybe to give me pleasure to another, maybe myself."
And it starts to say to itself that story, and since then he says it says that every great cool thing that <unk> it detects in his lover -- he adds up to his collection of <unk> <unk>
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> from <unk> they would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break it out.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is this an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
We are <unk> from the information.
<unk> use the details. <unk>
The <unk> you like the great <unk> of bright hair, and the cute little <unk>
They were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links right into the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> <unk> <unk> listening to the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "These scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're finding knowledge, search for a really painful thing, and in fact, what it is to be able to <unk> the more <unk> the most painful <unk>
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
He says, "A woman who is who makes us suffer, causes it into a range of much more profound feelings that a wise man who may be <unk>
It's telling us to go for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal ourselves to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us focus on this very <unk>
Is there any other emotion you will tell us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud went to a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said there there was something strange in that man, that didn't be <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it all the world.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing that, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> or don't even accidentally they <unk> with one man?
Freud said the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels, very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely more intensely we are, we are, we become the more we become fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to make acts lead to violent or illegal.
<unk> they drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan Michigan was at the age of <unk> was captured by having created on Facebook account from which they sent messages to horrible to itself, for a year.
For one year, it all year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk> I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How large, even though we <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of the <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> which is about how <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> kingdom of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, it can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting to what you have to take away from your being and you get under the floor -- you have to get out and put it down to your name, you take your cow <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you to <unk> all over the world, so I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good in the social media, where the coin is <unk> Right?
<unk> show you the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> they think of Professor <unk> that criminal.
But I've always experienced <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> needs the genius <unk>
Oh, <unk> it sounds so <unk>
We need their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the <unk> once you go back to note, <unk> <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, <unk> we're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to be <unk> their hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> it was transferred to the story. And it seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like trying to <unk> like an geometry, like an geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows to admire that idea of being he <unk>
It could still be so <unk>
What if <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relationship with the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to go from the greatness of the greatness in the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have to remember that we have the fiction of <unk>
It's only fiction -- the jealousy.
The fiction used to be used to the table.
And look what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary man, Tom <unk> the nuts the <unk> <unk> the <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July September of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin went out of the <unk> Sea <unk> 11, and it has gone over the Ross Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the surface of the surface of the surface -- it was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest supported at times in the history of the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars in the federal days, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo Apollo gave to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration with 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People killed people, including <unk>
But before the Apollo Apollo program went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface, which emerged after the death of Armstrong last year, is the most <unk>
So why would we care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 miles later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> the cynical response is that it was because the Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better <unk>
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> we give us a better idea.
John F. Have some of you ask, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might wonder, why is the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why to fly the <unk>
Why does Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're very simple, but because they're hard.
It was Jason <unk> for the <unk> the <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the East War.
At the time, the stronger emotion emotion is, you know, the core of the powers of the technology.
It was because it was a great thing to be able to do that.
The landing on the moon in the moon in the moon of <unk> technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> and <unk> the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what I Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
Over most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 Apollo crew flew 40,000 miles / hour.
Since the 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, the joyful optimism of the power of technology has been able to see that the problems we imagine that the technology will solve like to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure to be a clean energy, cure for cancer, or feeding to the world population seem to have a clean <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
He was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't get to the <unk> <unk> of the rocket Saturn
I knew this would be the last <unk> mission -- but I was completely sure that I would have to see the colonies on Mars to look at the colonies on Mars.
So that of what happened to our ability to solve the problem with the <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had been infected with trivial toys, things like <unk> and had enriched toys with things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms and algorithms that speed it up.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But don't solve the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> to Intel and <unk> and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, and the incentives that venture capitalists provide to the entrepreneurs.
Valley says that the venture investment is that caused by the creation of ideas by <unk> or even false problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> most of what is wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment, and they could get out to 10 years.
The <unk> have always had trouble to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which are in the long-term capital -- not have invested in the long-term capital of development -- haven't yet invested in development of technologies that are dedicated to solving big problems, because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems we can't solve the big problems are <unk>
Sometimes we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would take to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the wind and the <unk> is completely economic growth.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, scientists, and economists are aware of what politics and international treaties -- the development of the development of an alien energy -- a significant increase in research and <unk> and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy or the international policy or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, the big problems are not to be.
We know for the time a long time ago, these famines are result in the <unk> of food.
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are the political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and <unk> and <unk> but there will be famines as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The President <unk> gave the war of cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resilient to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem found to have effective treatments.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have and we have them, but these four elements of these four elements of the political leaders, and the population leaders have to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support it, it should be really a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability for the ability for the technology to solve big problems, it does with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is not a politician like John Kennedy who is that <unk> that <unk> the hard and there is not a popular mythology and a <unk> of science fiction system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even able to do any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start talking about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas <unk>
They're so common that they've become <unk> from our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a big decrease in trust, it's a very widespread belief is a very widespread story.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should bring the confidence.
I think the goal and the task and the task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, and I think it gives you a more clear idea.
First of all, why do people think the confidence has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will make me think that it may have dropped to some activities or institutions and institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have that.
But I can use the surveys of view, and the surveys of opinion -- are supposedly the source of belief that confidence has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there is no evidence of that.
I mean, the people that are <unk> about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political and they are still inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable people about 20 years ago, they still are fairly <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly at half the road.
But that's enough?
What users opinion is they are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do that?
What you see are the <unk> attitudes, which people are doing when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you to tell you about <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
I was <unk> on the <unk> teachers.
probably <unk> to ask, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, I trust you in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in the real life, we tend to make the confidence <unk>
We don't assume the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person's official or a person -- is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust I trust that I I trust I I trust I trust that I I know to give the class of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we all think of it all that knowledge and more <unk>
I believe that surveys very bad tools to measure the real trust, the real trust, because they're trying to make a good judgment of real, because they try to make a good judgment or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I think I will have more confidence in which it's <unk> trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I believe that those people who are <unk> their savings was called Mr. <unk> who disappeared with them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with this <unk> that's the right goal.
Once you tell you that you say, yes, that's what it means you say, yeah, that's not that trust, it's not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to make a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I believe that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is competent in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But yes, the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends to be competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> <unk> before we do that.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of people, professional officials and others, and so forth, and so that that we make us easier for us to judge of their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as a <unk>
I remember once I was talking about a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem as you take more time to do the administrative <unk> that will be <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in our public life, and we find the same problem in all of our public and <unk> that is going to ensure <unk> and <unk> evidence and <unk> evidence.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks like them, understand them -- who are <unk> as we say.
You must all know that you all know similar examples.
You get all that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you think about being worthy of confidence and <unk> to the people that are reliable to the people that are reliable and whether other officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't make it properly.
Third, I do the task.
We were going to the task rebuild the <unk> puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if you're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately it's signature because you give them some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have ever given you.
You have to give them the foundations so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> through all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That's every day, everywhere, do the common people -- the <unk> the institutions, the institutions, the institutions, the institutions, the institutions, the institutions, the institutions, and the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- he says I can <unk>
I take them and get it back and get it back for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I believe that what we're looking for is not very difficult to <unk>
What people are rely on relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've come to be <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, such as an point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there were no <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that it was going to happen in the digital space, so when the <unk> is against the <unk> <unk>
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool we break down the barriers.
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole dexterity ability.
In the division of Science <unk> of Microsoft, with Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard digital area of the workplace.
You know, a transparent bombsight with a depth of cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can put your hands in the keyboard, you can now get the inside of the space of 3D space, and grab right there.
As the windows and the archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can look and the book and the words and the words and the words and words with the virtual touch sensor that is down from every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with the hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information comes to us?
And so many of us will be bought and get back to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists in the space, how can we make the physical and <unk>
So what would a future like this?
In the lab at the MIT Media Lab and my tutor <unk> <unk> and my collaborator <unk> that we created this only <unk> physicist.
This <unk> magnet is acts as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both of the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement by a combination of levitation and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when we programming the object, we released it from the restrictions of the constraints of time and space, which is to say that human movements can <unk> and return to reproduce and get to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach you, physically and physically and distance and the famous and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality sometimes you can play with.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physical <unk> and, unlike the monitors or the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what is more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program to the world is going to change our daily activities our daily activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just showing us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to be <unk> of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but we started to get that barrier, the only limit that you can have imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was first grade, the government wanted to lead to a school to athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
Then there was to survive the Cultural Revolution, creating firmly believe that there was only an effective way to <unk> a safe work and <unk> work.
No matter if your work would like work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer <unk>
This was me in my imaginary <unk>
An opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult adults get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I think that during the rest of my life -- a <unk> happiness that was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one of me wanted to do it. Okay.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> It's Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but you weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, so much better than I did it.
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to <unk> the relationship to my parents.
I find it with a new culture that also gave me to my reading <unk>
It was a lot of <unk>
For example, at the beginning of this map I found it out of place because this is what the students in China you learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map is a map of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research in research as a comparative religion and comparative <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers to the academic deeper understanding of a <unk>
And I thought that if the fact that I read the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two to two.
You can be from <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk>
For the <unk> <unk> are economic economic for political and spiritual <unk>
In the Buddha, they are all <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> Thomas <unk> of <unk> Alan <unk> -- instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it is through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese -- literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books came to me with a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to get to feeling or powerless to feel like ever.
Having a dream was <unk> it's nothing compared to what many other others have ever <unk>
I've come to believe that college is not the only purpose of a dream.
Her most important purpose is connect to the place that you come to the dreams, where the passion comes from.
Even a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm happy -- happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So, the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in the clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex came to the first session by Alex entered and a <unk> he threw on the couch from my office and he took her shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk> I felt so <unk>
My partner partner had a <unk> like the first <unk>
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought back to the <unk> it became easy to just move my head as it comes to the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> said Alex, and what I saw she was right.
You start working next to work after, it has children later, to death after the death after.
For the <unk> as Alex and I had time from the entire <unk>
But shortly later, my <unk> pushed me to press that I talk to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, come out with the guys under your category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe you have the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex was pause in the development.
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences not only to Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, but for the careers, the families and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one comes to age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Ah, Yes! It's amazing. It's amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream out of a <unk> I want to take your <unk> <unk> you really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be at the age of 35 years.
This means that eight from every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give her life have happened for when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money you <unk>
We know more than half the Americans are married, they are married, they live in their own partner to the 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change your own, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality it changes more times during your <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility reaches its top of 28 and things get complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their daily lives have an impact on the person you <unk> it has an impact on the person you <unk>
But what we don't hear about often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> you're listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the middle of the time.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence for <unk>
The journalists asked them, names <unk> to the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered <unk> what is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
And <unk> were saying that for achieving big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that right?
What do you believe that happens when you give you a <unk> on your head and you say, "You have 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole it to that person's sense of urgency and ambition and he has absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, economically interesting as you or your children and daughters and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, it's not good for me, but this relationship doesn't just work for me, <unk>
Or do they say, "All you have a career before you start a career before the 30, everything is <unk>
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My "My God, are there for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better tales the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes <unk> during the <unk> of the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, the <unk> and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stand stop, so sometimes I think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to the <unk> there is an enormous pressure of the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, and have two or three children in a period of a long time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is much more difficult and bothered to do everything in the <unk>
The <unk> crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize that you can't have the child now, or you can't have a brother brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but they still couldn't decide, so I spent the past years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living in a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
You were often often on our <unk> but then she gets up to her own to say, "One doesn't choose your family, but you can choose to your friends."
Well, a day Emma got his head on her legs and cried for almost all the time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his lot -- but then he was looking at the empty space that followed after the words in emergency case in emergency case -- please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw it, and he said, "Who is to me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care if you give me to <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist it and I don't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned so much since I worked with Alex and I just went through the <unk> of Emma going through the <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to him about Emma three things or woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I said to <unk> that <unk> of the identity of this identity is and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital of identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this life capital generates of identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, that you want to try to try to give you a <unk>
I'm not <unk> the <unk> exploration, I'm going to <unk> the exploration that should not tell -- by the way, is not exploration, that by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to him that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great friends to take you to the airport, but the <unk> they come together with friends with minds like you know what you know about, how do you think about, how do you think about, how do you work.
That new piece of capital, that new person in the person who will come out almost always come from their <unk>
Things come from the new things that are called weak bonds friends of friends.
Yes, half the <unk> they have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the <unk> created never to be <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a work for a job yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
By the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family when a couple of partner in their own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
You may think that 30 is better enough to sit head than 20 or even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person you live that you live in now, or you're going to go back when everyone on Facebook you start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means to be so intentional in love as you are at work.
You get your family to be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just to work or kill you with who you have to work or kill you who you can choose to you.
So what happened to the <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a cousin that worked in a art museum in a art museum in another state.
This weak link, helped her get a work out there.
That offer of work to leave the boyfriend, they had to be able to leave the boyfriend, they had to be able to leave the boyfriend,
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special in museums.
This married a man who chose to <unk>
I had his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the contacts spaces of the emergency room are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that go from the Los Angeles airport that goes somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a <unk> <unk> the difference between land makes the difference in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or at the age and even the <unk> a good TED Talk, a good TED Talk.
Here is my idea worth spreading to all the child in the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of saying <unk> as Emma all the <unk> the <unk> are not the new <unk> they get their identity capital, use their weak bonds choose to your family.
You don't have to define what they didn't know or what they didn't know did.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> work management for a work that was even more <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to high school students in New York in New York City.
And as any professor, I took tests and tests.
I give them assignments.
When the work I work came back to grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest children weren't going so well.
And so it made me think.
The kinds of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh -- safe, sure, they are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not <unk> and I was really convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard to work hard for time.
After many years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and your life depends much more more than the ability to learn how to learn how to learn how you can learn how to learn and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk> <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> on military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> and we were trying to predict what kids would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied by professors <unk> working in slums. And what teachers still will be teaching for the end of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking for asking them what these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who will make more money?
In all of these very different contexts, arose that we had a feature of a major <unk> of the success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and the physical health and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is <unk>
The determination is clinging to their future day after day, not just the week, not just for the week, but for the years, and working really hard to make that future.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of schools of high school who did my questionnaires and then I waited for over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every single feature that could measure, things like family income, even safety they felt the kids when they were at school.
So it's not only in West <unk> or at the National <unk> National <unk> in which matters in school, especially for the kids at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little most of you know, the science of the science of the <unk>
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development in children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust <unk>
How do I keep them motivated motivated them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I do is that the talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who are just not going to keep on their <unk>
In fact, in our data, it is commonly not related to, or it is even related to agriculture measurements.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the children's determination is something called <unk> from <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University, <unk> and the belief is that the belief that the ability to learn is not to learn that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows into the challenge, and how it changes and it grows into the challenge, you are much more likely to <unk> when you go to because you don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether it's been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, ourselves to start all of the new things with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined to make our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother and the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be so <unk> like the Big <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been asking me to ask me if I can bring down this <unk> so that whoever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes from every character in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes -- it's better than do it in a simpler and simple.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic literacy for knowledge.
The first 200 will allow you to understanding 40 percent of the main literature, the basic literature, <unk> <unk> understand the basic idea of pages or the newspapers.
Today I would start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open their mouth as well as possible until it becomes <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both place, like it was shouting <unk> <unk> -- I'm <unk> this is actually <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I'm <unk> this is actually <unk> -- but I like to believe that it's the other one that works.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a pair of gates of <unk> in the <unk>
I call it radical to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they think many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, I said, two are a company, three are a crowd.
If one person you stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside whale
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> <unk> -- it's a rather idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three fireworks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun into the sun, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk>
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> there is someone at home?
This person is coming out from a <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful <unk>
So we've spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters to build another 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of thousands of <unk> which is the same thing to learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after I knew the <unk> we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun that is put in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun in the beginning, we created Japan. We create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left to the left are two stacked <unk>
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese are <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it comes to is a <unk>
This is a slide for remind you that I must stop talking and <unk>
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician, of Oz together.
The movie <unk> its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand to use and get a brilliant wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of an industrial complex industrial complex.
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
So the trend really took up 40 years later with it -- interestingly, a film called <unk> a metal boy and a metal boy to a girl dressed in the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician and the <unk> and all the movies we see today.
One is that there is very little violence on the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, aggressive as <unk>
But I believe that if the magician, of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of the <unk> the <unk> you are <unk>
You do magic shoes, to defeat the armies made by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the <unk> the <unk> of Oz and wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did to see Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son.
Just three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance -- there was <unk>  And so she slid into the room and was impressed like a foot with her foot with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but I would say, <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be topics of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would make a sense that Luke is a military to remove the government?
Do this with the <unk> of Oz to <unk>
How do it do it <unk> their movie?
And we do good <unk> with all of them and <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to <unk> and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital together in the movies for our children, and so little of the movies of the <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in male in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by the experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide the proper framework that would have served to the world of adults who are <unk>   I think at the first of the first <unk> I really expected that the credits begin to come up because the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I got a <unk>
Why keep up there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on <unk> the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend out of the Disney versus any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they guys, they're not really your goal.
They do a phenomenal work to teach girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but not stop being <unk>
Of course, the most successful theme issue of all times last times in a classic every single one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who raised a little girl.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what critical criticism came from.
I can't believe that Pixar is made of a <unk>
It's really good -- I don't let you have that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't been <unk> but maybe maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is an comics, book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of mine on the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions supposed to be <unk> in the movie, there is more of a female character that has <unk>
So you get the <unk>
These women talk to each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the guy than <unk> right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things in the other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to a very good <unk> film, <unk>
Right? <unk> de <unk> success of <unk> a sense of consensus from what a Hollywood film is.
<unk> doesn't happen the test.
And I don't believe that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film happen in a embassy where men and women are hidden in the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk> into bed, <unk> to the bed, <unk> to the bed, <unk> to the bed, <unk> to the bed, <unk> to the bed, <unk> to the bed, and to say, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we went to the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 folk <unk> how many of them believe they have protagonists have protagonists have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage of women that we have been chosen to Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a number one that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "This is what he said,
In the United States, one of five three women says it's sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that music videos or pornography are tightly <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male owns is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, and he has a woman who has no friends.
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and very <unk> <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our own <unk> like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> -- but I have to ask you to ask: <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating and we're educating our kids to be able to keep their <unk>
I mean, I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean by parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the way your home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these monkeys have in common?
Maybe it's not just the bright <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies who know more than anyone, and I love to share their knowledge with other people to be able to get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories when I tell my <unk> <unk> and I want to have a lot of stories where your job is to join a team, maybe a team led to a team that led for women, to help other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician.
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked it was to look for sea cookies at the shores of Maine at the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, with time, I would get myself to <unk>
I started seeing ways and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up for almost 1.3 miles from the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place that this is a place that's located in the East <unk>
And the place, a simple view, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using the <unk> and we process using it, suddenly you see the <unk>
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes in the landscape caused by the materials materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find a old ancient city, called a lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle <unk> <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art, <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, I Before, the <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, I moved to the time, and it went to the entire city.
So how do a city to find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try to find a random equivalent to looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we do use NASA data to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that you see inside the circle here, we think it might be the location here, that we think it might be the location.
So we collaborated with the scientists of Egyptians doing <unk> <unk> you can see here.
When I say <unk> is how you take you from a sample in ice, you know, but instead of layers of climate change, we find layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, below a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> of a number hundreds of years coming back from the Empire of the Empire <unk> exactly the same period as we think the same is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used to <unk> the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire is in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite <unk> shop that proves that what has been there was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but I will come to the place in a future <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can do great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote with the <unk> of the Empire of the Empire of the Empire of the Empire -- was probably <unk>
To share knowledge is the most of the <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to TED -- TED wasn't founded in 1984 C. C.
Do the ideas really started to really happen in 1984 B.C. in a lost city for a lost city not for a long time not a long time and found from high school.
It certainly gets the search to shells <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to just close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now we were a bunch of obese <unk>
They are competing in a bicycle <unk> and they are in the direction of the <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they travel against the front door of your house.
There are bikes flying around everywhere, wheels that go on their side, lightning in the wheels that end up in places called <unk> the threshold on the door, <unk>
And then you go to the hall, or what you have on the door, and look at the quality of the light, and you just notice the quality of the light.
It's <unk> <unk>
From a <unk>
It's a horse that speaks to speech.
You can feel your blue fur, tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you have to go to the mouth.
They go on one side and trained to be in their living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's very <unk> clothing, dancing on his center, singing <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> bricks and from the oven. They come to you -- the Man of the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the Len is <unk> of the <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is happening every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to covering this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, I guess, is like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
You can see who could memorize the <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man called Ed <unk> who had come from England and it has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition are normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using a few years ago, invented a half a years ago in Greece, in the same techniques that used to memorize their narratives that the <unk> used to used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, "How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant man, and she said, "You know, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? Why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney Britney <unk> how to <unk> the order of a deck of video games in live in a private television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up most of the year in the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, and what sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be like.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem with <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see where our memory does that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> <unk> <unk> for the paper of <unk> <unk>
We went one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, was <unk>
And to come back, a number of treaties on the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, and then in the <unk> and then the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is, there was a time when this idea of having memory and <unk> and <unk> it wasn't such a rare thing as rare today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, they provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made us possible for our modern world, but they've changed us.
And they have changed, and I would argue that they've changed our own cognitive ones.
Like we have no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten to how do we do that.
One of the last places on our planet where you find people who are passionate about this idea of a memory <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's not really that <unk> there are <unk> in the whole world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do these people.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University of London was invited to a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to find that they have brains in a certain way, they wanted to find brains in a certain way, and different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and meaningful between the brains of the memory champions and the issues of control and the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, <unk> <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, they found that in the memory champions and they found that in the memory champions -- they found that in the memory champions -- different from the brain, different than others.
They are actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a race race where someone comes to someone with a new way to remembering more and then the rest of the competitors -- then the rest of the competitors to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On the desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try and memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques using the end of the end, it gets a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell two people to remember the same word <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, tell me that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you later -- that word I told you about a <unk>
Do you know what <unk>
The person who told him that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember remembering the same word as the person who told what their job is to be <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name doesn't really mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship for you.
With all the other memories that dance in your head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started putting it out <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates rise to two and a half years ago in Greece -- <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> which I went to a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring up to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory <unk> and he <unk> and as soon as he was, the room of the <unk>
They were <unk>
But not only killed them, but not only killed all the bodies -- <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting.
So they could not get <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
And he stopped standing outside, only in the middle of the rubble, closed eyes, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
I took the family family <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it's that no matter if we're not good to remember or phone numbers or instructions and the word <unk> of our colleagues, we have visual memory and visual memory <unk>
If you tell me that I was going to be the first 10 words of the history that I just told you about <unk> it's very likely that you can do it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you tell you who I was sitting on the <unk> <unk> in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your eyes and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> the crazy thinking, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the most <unk> image.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, the first business treaties to the first <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage here to give a talk and they want to do it memory, the same way that he would have done to the first way that she would have been invited to <unk> years ago.
What you could do is figure out that you're on your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention this completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind that anecdote <unk> that you want to count.
And then they come in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk to the <unk> would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends for them to help them.
This is like the <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word -- which is typical of the word <unk>
In fact the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of the people who thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I went up with full of it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> <unk>
But seriously, it's like to see a lot of people sitting sitting on taking exams. I mean, I mean, the most exciting thing about when someone is <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there's incredible things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell me this story, I needed to try to put me in your place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to the New York Times -- just trying to see something.
Maybe a poem. Or a poem. You probably have the old school names <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to <unk>
It was fun. Because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images by <unk> and <unk> <unk> and hopefully in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my training team training for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some safety glasses leaving tape leaving two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of an association <unk>
So I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had been covered a year before. He had the idea that I could tell you in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve a good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so <unk> <unk> that work that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need that you have to put it into the memory <unk> or <unk> <unk> to benefit from <unk> to the <unk> of how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it would be a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We focus that when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make it <unk>
We have a sort of deep processing processing that most of them are not going to be <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things make things happen.
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today -- is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk into our side, we are going to be so <unk> we will be so <unk>
I learned from the first hand, I learned that incredible memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a living life, you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so let's just take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I was from <unk> and she was six years old, and he lived there at home of my parents called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, the bathroom that share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom had a balcony that gave the living room.
And there was all the time when I was watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom everyone would see me, and every time I went back, and I would come back in a <unk>
And I was like this.
It was <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I took that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that <unk>
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and architecture is not about math, but of those of those emotional connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we want.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under their time under 90 percent of their time.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building as this, I know what you care about, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think that as we based on a building that we built a 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that use to create an emotional connection to the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we use this trick for a long long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
You see, these stable, stable, stable <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it's it takes for a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, always fear of innovation, are always afraid to innovation, and they want to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found it with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library that ended in 2004, in my hometown, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing round columns, <unk> red, which they leave <unk> what we <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> kids, the values values the property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other side of the country, ended up another library, he looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new type of public equipment for the city, a place to come up, reading and to get around.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both of so-called two buildings, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects that constantly make new technologies, new technologies new solutions for the current forms of life forms.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we move away from the people.
And all of the black, we love you, you believe we feel very well, but we're dead very well, but we're dead in the way we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience the <unk> the <unk> the back and over and over and over the last 300 years, and it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago -- the <unk> years ago.
The architects were busy busy the architects were busy <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Very hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we get to incorporate those symbols.
You get the <unk> of the new <unk>
We take those ways that we know that we like the <unk>
And <unk> <unk> and <unk> and we used the bake new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> and we turn them into <unk> which can be <unk> that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
Number one.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we are moving to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies of <unk>
Those fantasies they could be <unk> to the French or the French or the Italian.
Maybe with an endless <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know it very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are frustrated about frustrated and started doing <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
In the 1980s and the early '90s, and the early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> symbols now -- we have new <unk> design techniques now -- and we find new <unk> some forms of <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> -- you are totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building is fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of these rare moments when academic <unk> and public in general, they were completely aware of a building.
New York Times Times <unk> this <unk> construction was <unk>
Tourism tourism in Bilbao is a 2,500 percent when they ended the building.
So, all of a sudden, the world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, New York City, Cleveland, Seattle, New York, Cleveland,
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and wild and wild ways, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms of these shapes meant that culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the same thing the main mayors in the world.
And so everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon of the beginning new <unk> with other architects <unk>
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to spend all of architecture, social media started going to increase the speed of information consumption of information.
Think of for example, how do architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have had walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is spread beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, it means that the speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before the one who designed four years ago was successful or successful.
Because there's never good at architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years old, but about 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk> it was because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to be going back to <unk> because we are on the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media -- the media starts to <unk> every time faster, even faster, even at the end of the <unk> and the <unk> -- effectively the difference between innovation and <unk> between us, the architects, and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> an emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building ended up the building, was a part of the community, and as the drawings were seemed exactly the same as the product finished, there was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get it and share it in social media, the building stopped being a <unk> it became an media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that made the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it to the collective memory of collective memory, and it makes us with the collective memory and we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed between us and the buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building has been built today, first of the Internet to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library is.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that are using words <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer an <unk> public that accepts something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop by the architecture.
That means that <unk> <unk> of one another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can keep forward and find solutions right now to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space is in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
And this means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with the base of ideas in which it must be <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we'll ultimately be ready for the ways to produce.
That means that buildings will be <unk> in the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, can also serve to make sport or to <unk> or even one can be married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream a swimming in the East East New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make it more green and more <unk>
We have been waiting for all of you to want you to.
Finally, we are not on the opposite sides.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of a game.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it up to the more <unk> the local libraries the local libraries and the homes where we form our kids, and the wake up.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year to a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives it to the same as those <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom realize I used to do that, and I thought I would say, "When couple of you do this?
How is it that we are not really comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people were looking for the Google "I'm <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom says it all the time it was a beautiful, every day in school, someone told me it's ugly.
Among what your mom tells you and what your friends, or of the school -- and the school -- they say, don't know who believe.
So a video of her own, he puts it on her on her on her on YouTube, put it on YouTube, and he puts others who have a <unk> "I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> have gotten more than 13 to <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a regular and normal teenager who receives these answers on one of their stages in their most emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They are under pressure from being online and available all the time, speaking, that by giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected to a continuous way -- so young.
As a mother and told me, "It's like a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be connected to our children is <unk> by our children to <unk> based on the number of enthusiasm that they do.
There is no division between a living life and the real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what you're <unk>
What is it in the life of somebody else in front of you in front of what is normal in a <unk>
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the stories of the days.
<unk> <unk> still dominate our <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is now routine.
And they like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who call it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what the young girls are.
But the kids also are immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the superheroes in the sport, and the Iranian singers and the singers in.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture who is obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort, for all of the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical ability, their studies and other ways they start to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls who prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as a <unk> to society and to the working field and the working field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of classroom because they don't want to be <unk> because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One of them five is not <unk> in classes at all the time when they don't feel comfortable with it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't believe you are good, specifically if you don't believe you are angry enough enough to the average of your peers who don't care about it about appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it goes regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be good of course, we are talking about how you see you are not really talking about how you see it.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-worth self-esteem -- they eat less fruit and vegetables, they are in more diets and vegetables, they are in more diets that can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they are in the risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what they make decisions more <unk> like alcohol to the <unk> of alcohol and by drugs, <unk> aesthetic surgery, relationships for early and without protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe that they're overweight and they don't have a higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day they don't feel secure with the way they can see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways that the first is we have to nurture it in your own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed at me when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing that, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children are not just going to have a positive impact but also an <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends, and relationships.
And these six aspects of these six aspects of these six things to provide their education into their body education that works.
A education is a fundamental <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
I challenge the status status of the current of the women in the view and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell that with our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that the determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not because they can see it.
All of us can start by doing by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people on their effort and their actions and not on their appearance.
And let me ask you, When it was the last time I had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as our government and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our kids grow to grow the whole person, valuing the individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people to really make the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the top screen because we only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they believe that they are never <unk> of being who who are, or to achieve what they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is to mind?
It's your <unk>
It's your <unk>
It's your <unk>
It's his <unk>
It could just be simply the woman who's going to two seats at a distance. What would it mean for her if she was released from that <unk> voice, in their interior, who was not having long legs long legs -- a <unk>
What would it mean for her, if we were <unk> that makes your potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is holding them all to us.
But let's take our kids to the truth.
You know, the way you see that it's just a part of your identity, you know, the truth is that we love them, for those who are and what do you feel.
We get to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age of today, becoming into insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the five o'clock in November of the 1990s, a guy named <unk> <unk> and he went to a hotel with <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense of Defense <unk>
As initially as initially as initially as initially as a prisoner for other <unk> they started planning on <unk> they started planning on about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans are driven by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the 1993 bomb of 1993 at the World Trade Center was able to be able to.
Later on, would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, in 1983, with an Indian engineer, with an American loving engineer, at the age of elementary school at the age of two who did everything by giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims who come to meet.
By the experience I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't need much to get the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in the human group, there is always a small fraction of the people that are <unk> to their convictions that think that they think that we have to use all the means for all of the possible means that we all have to be able to use all the means so that they all lived as them.
A few months before he arrest me and explained to me and explained to me that in the last weekends -- he and some friends, had been going to dance training in Long Island, and to practice. Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go on the next day.
We came to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk>
When I was <unk> my father helped me to hold his <unk> on his shoulder and explained to how to point at about 30 feet.
That day, the last bullet who shot him gave the little orange orange light on the goal and just for all of the surprise and, especially of mine, all of me, the whole goal on fire.
My uncle turned into the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
Of such a parent, I was a son.
All of all, the comment on all the <unk> made a lot of a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could be able to <unk>
Those people later they would be condemned to put them out later that they would be charged with 700 pounds of explosives in the north tower -- Center for a blast that killed six people and <unk> for 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood, not making a lot of them.
Every time I started to feel comfortable with about someone already was a moment of packing and getting to the other city.
As I was always me -- the new face was that I was often a <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white but will be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time it was happening at home reading books, watching TV or playing TV games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, social skills, to put it under <unk> not prepared for the real world.
I was raised opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the first way of thinking about it was in the presidential election, 2000.
On a <unk> program, in which I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I was a victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt so passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had done to friendship, was Jewish Jewish boys who had done to friendship, was Jewish Jewish guys.
I took several days coming out to the light, this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine, and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that the entire life had ever been done to me.
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work when I got a summer work at the Bush <unk>
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned a fundamental key into the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and a sin -- every gay was bad <unk>
I had the chance to work with gay actors to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly how to treat it as to <unk>
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that had been taught to me as a child in the experience of interaction with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is to be taken by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart asked me to be honest with my <unk> and helped to see that the race of the people, the religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure.
On occasions, inspired inspiration can come from the unexpected influence in my own life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother and how I was changing my way and told me something that you keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
And she looked at me with the tired eyes <unk> of someone who had enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep keeping all that hate to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and to start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put me in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to bring them to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though me <unk> to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have to get me to <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism, I talk against those <unk> <unk> of my father's actions of my father.
With this <unk> <unk> I'm here as proof that violence is not inherent inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to keep their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.
At this moment there is a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D and it has sound in 3D and it has <unk> and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moments of childhood moments that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on the flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the film, you're you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the experience and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There is nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know that I have a little awareness.
I don't have certainty that you're aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason for a living.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots -- what we get to produce results without experiencing the <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
And so that to integrate consciousness into the consciousness of science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Well, science, by nature, it's objective
awareness, by nature, it's subjective subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we have that vision.
The psychology is when the behavioral psychology is due to the <unk> neuroscience, the neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
And even 30 years ago, when TED started so few scientists very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> about 20 years ago, all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the moment for the science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years recent years was the pursuit of correlations by correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I did Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience or to feel pain or feeling pain or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not an science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences, are related to certain kinds of experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions saying that this kind of work that we want to explain some questions to explain the questions about what certain areas of the brain is.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Without <unk> to the <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Now, not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why is it all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal internal movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The classic <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, and how they operate <unk> how they are <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> are engaged and <unk> the living organisms -- all these living organisms.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and brain functions and the brain functions as a <unk> phenomenon, how to <unk> how we talk to how we talk to <unk> these are questions questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behaviors of the behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it all behavior is that all behavior accompanied from a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, the standard paradigm.
I am a <unk>
I want a scientific theory that works for a long time, and it would hit me on the face against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we get to focus on this point.
We have a range of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemical chemistry, the chemical chemistry, explains biology, chemistry explains biology memory.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit to fit in this <unk>
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea of the scientific view of the world.
I believe that consciousness, right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view from the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly anomaly -- you can have radical ideas, I think we need radical ideas before we can deal with a crazy ideas before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective internal movie -- includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do is to explain the functions to the <unk> functions, the behaviors of the brain, and it studies everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to by simply denying that the observation of consciousness is living.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I believe can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws fundamental laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties and fundamental properties and fundamental properties.
Instead, it's considered fundamental, and you build the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you cannot explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental <unk> space, so long, -- dough -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, you cannot explain the consciousness in the terms of fundamental things, and long, mass, then it's <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object.
It opens the road to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws of consciousness, the laws that consciousness, the laws of consciousness with other <unk> the space -- time, the mass, the mass, of physicists.
Now, physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws we want to be fundamental laws so simple that we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every single system, is aware, not only humans human, flies, mice, flies, flies even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that the photons are smart or smart to <unk>
It's not that a <unk> I can be filled with anguish when you think about "Oh, I always travel to the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps the photons can have some element of <unk> raw <unk> some precursor precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy thing to you.
How would someone think that something so <unk>
This is part of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's a fundamental space, the time and the mass, and the mass, is natural <unk> that can be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although even though the idea it seems to us, it's a lot less for the people of different culture, where the human mind seems to be more <unk> with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with the information.
Whenever there's information, there's a bit of information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human being, a human <unk>
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years of the recent years -- I took this kind of theory and it developed <unk> with this kind of theory and <unk>
It has a math measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to do that with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's incredible degree of information, <unk> a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a <unk> of information integration of information, but quite a significant degree of <unk>
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, you particles, particles, the <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of consciousness -- there will still be a level of consciousness today.
Indeed, a fundamental law is a fundamental law of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers and often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure structure using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the below.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the <unk> of the <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of the physics of the physics of the physics, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that you put fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness isn't outside the physical world in that physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there.
This vision, I think, is the <unk> vision, has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences, and it can have social consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I was not supposed to eat anything that I had consciousness, then I must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you embrace that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think I think it really tends to transform your <unk> while what it matters in terms of ethical <unk> and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What's about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a processing of complicated information processing -- so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are right now, they are really passionate about ethical problems, very serious about the ethics of intelligent computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the <unk> of collective collective consciousness on the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a richer level, a group integrated as the audience in a TED Talk, and we have a TED consciousness, a TED movie for this full of the TED group of TED every one of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I don't think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm really sure the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that consciousness is a really universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of serious.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I believe that we will get to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand consciousness and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an profile of education.
I went to school with my friends, <unk> with my friends, <unk> with my sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to be a prize for a community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a problem.
She actually hasn't <unk>   And they were right.
I went to the school, he had good grades. After the school, I had a <unk> in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching of the high school school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes at the 11 minutes -- he raised the hand and he said, "Hey, when I'll give you your <unk>
And I said, "What's a <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheels of the wheels, they talk about it <unk>
The general, <unk> in the <unk>
And it was, when I realized, this child had experiences with disabled people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, is to say, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability aren't our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to be there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> I'm going to do in this one of the wheels, and you're probably waiting for them to <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you are interested in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us to lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and live with a disability is something wrong with you for you.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make you great remarkable.
And over the last few years, we have been able to get even more to this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by a <unk>
You may have seen a child running with <unk> legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call porn.
And I use the term porn term <unk> because they were going to be a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we <unk> the disabled taxpayers of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, very bad than my life, may be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times the number of times that have been <unk> strange to expressing that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work for a public profile.
It was like me to get out in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images these images, these images, <unk> people with disabled people with no disability.
You're there to be there for you to think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
We have some things.
But the things that we associate are not the things you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I told me to the social model of the social model, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that tells us that we are more disabled, because of our bodies or as diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
So the things that I need you to do, and I have learned to get the best of your ability to get it, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their bodies out.
So it's really fair <unk> in the way we do that, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold to this lie that disability is that disability is that disability makes us.
And honestly, I don't honestly do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, and you think, and you think, "Oh you are not sometimes inspired by something wrong.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability everywhere.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than it is that it was lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a cool idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that get me fall away from the <unk>  <unk> the clever trick of how to load cell battery battery into the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold to the disability that have been sold to the most <unk>
It makes us the hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's because it's because of the social model of disability.
A bunch of smiles in front of a steps has never done to become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and they have a positive attitude turning all of those books <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom looking at the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be in a <unk>
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who are disability to be <unk> for the <unk> and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 degree high school is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us care, but to question what you think is to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional reality with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of these questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of the fact that the people think about it, they think about <unk> and Tom <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that happens in our days and it will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to <unk> because the augmented reality will change our lives as well as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get the reality out.
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of them are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see I see.
It will allow you to experience what it's being a professional <unk>
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run out of the game to 160 <unk>
We can know that it feels like a 110 pounds out of <unk> trying to figure out it out all their being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So some videos to show you what it is to use the Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine going to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, is a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field is in the <unk> perspective.
You have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> coffee.
Blue 8, Blue Ghraib <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling in the field, being in the field, but has nothing to do with being in <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players -- and I've asked me to YouTube and asked me to see it from the angle of a <unk> <unk>

We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we get it to the next <unk>
We take it to that level using something called the <unk> <unk> which surely many people know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why I will show you why I was with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in Russian rollercoaster experience.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from the arm before running and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running the ball at the bottom of the network? -- or they were <unk> by doing a <unk>
What is their experience when it comes to a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk>
Maybe they would be <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not actually <unk> yet.
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get the reality back? It was <unk>
<unk> reality reality, when the <unk> <unk> and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They make them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put it into their <unk> to her field of field so that they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl <unk> that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, and more exciting, people looked at the game.
In 1994, I <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the field of <unk> and then in the field of the defenses.
They had more juggling because it was more quick, because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine you are a player going back to their group, and you see the next show that you see the next show that you are in front of you to forget a <unk>
It is to memorize the strategy.
They just go into the field and they react.
And the coaches want to do it because if they don't follow their instructions, they are lost -- they are missing -- and they hate <unk>
If you lose party parties, you lose <unk>
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality reality is not just a <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple choice would be a camera in every corner of the stadium in the stadium -- having a view from the top of the <unk>
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working.
And all that information, you send to your players.
The good teams will know it.
The bad people will get out of information.
This is <unk> to the good equipment.
So your computer equipment to be so important in your <unk> and your data analysis will stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
So imagine that you're the field.
You get the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you get a defense behind you is going to be a defense behind you -- it's not <unk> but the <unk> system.
We are <unk> to the <unk>
Another <unk> you tell you, there's an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you land, though, the receptor you see in your bombsight is an area of grass that is <unk> and you can modify the career.
It takes <unk> it takes <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the fans have followed by each angle.
This is something that we create a massive emotion in the game.
Let me make you lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the fields.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be a part of the sports reality because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of <unk> reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone as human beings -- to show someone to be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show to <unk> <unk> how evil is their actions from the perspective of the perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show to show the world how to be <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the choices we do and the challenges we face, is as usual as we do.
Thank you.
I was recently told by 23 years in the service of the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years in the country -- the end of the <unk> Lofa County -- which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known in the world of the beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet imam for suicide, being one of the most used in the world.
The Roman Roman bridge was open to <unk>
Joseph <unk> <unk> a head of the head of the <unk> he said, "The bridge is almost a <unk>
<unk> it is not practical and not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that travel between the two towers will be in the other dimension, this bridge has to come up with another dimension, that the fall from he released from all your concerns and the waters that go under <unk> your <unk>
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body bumps against about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is <unk> the bones, some of which are living organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that don't normally get in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't believe that <unk> this method of suicide is to realize that <unk> death method.
This is the wire.
Except except about the two towers, there is 32 inches of steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they take their life.
I can tell you by the experience that once the person is on that edge, and in your top time, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this photo last year while this young man talking to an officer in his life.
I want to tell you with joy that day to bring it back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who get suicide, but to officials as well.
We've moved a long way back then.
Today, veterans officers, train and trained to the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the <unk> of <unk> from the past year by a possible subject terrorist subject in the <unk> near <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason talking with a bridge of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason had only 32 years old, and I had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up until two times before in the New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking about <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> and he started to the Earth <unk> and he sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You will never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get me to <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came from <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And then Jason asked me, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped the <unk> he leaned into the right, and he was gone.
This kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk> smart and intelligent guy in New Jersey was just taking the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the children's rabbi me to see me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason the father of Jason to the <unk>
<unk> damage about suicide to affect a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, you or someone loved it to be <unk>
What do you <unk>
What does that mean?
In my experience, you don't only have to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel it, because you probably don't do it?
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and you don't have to ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: "Is it very similar to the very similar circumstances you thought about to end your life.
They can save the person in front of them can save life and be the point point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never going to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to do the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son on the January of January of this year, and he wrote this email only a couple of days, and he is with his permission, and blessing who I read the read.
"Hi, I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you with a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends talking to your friends, and so on.
I'm still fairly <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco at San Francisco -- the 19 of 49 with his father the 19 to the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as it disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers next to my home and told me that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness I had seen him jump from the <unk> to the <unk>
Thanks a lot of because because of those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before bad without being suffering from a real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> Bridge Bridge Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the road that his son took that day, and also the courage to go out and get the courage to go out.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and <unk>
On March June 11, 2005, to a radio call by a radius of the <unk> of a bridge -- on the sidewalk on the sidewalk to the north.
I was <unk> my motorcycle <unk> and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, immediately, immediately, and he was stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the hour and the next half and I heard like Kevin and he talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day to go back to that lane and give it to another opportunity.
When Kevin did when Kevin did it.
"This is a new <unk> a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that made it <unk> and gave you the hope and the life else <unk>
And you know what told me.
He said, "I'm <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter to a Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> Nothing erase the 11th events -- and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I believe that Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I had a six months when I had six months -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as a says.
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, she <unk> <unk> when I visited the General of San Francisco at the San Francisco -- you were <unk>
I did that I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
He talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story to inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of their own pain, to the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the suicide.
For most of the people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt other person.
They just want their own pain away.
Typically, this is achieved by three things: sleep, or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in with hundreds of mental diseases and calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved -- I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And during that time, I was <unk> hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, these few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about that one percent or two, the most of those people have said that the railing they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected <unk> with San Francisco, but also to the people.
That connection, or a bridge that every and every one of us and every one of us should be working to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you don't are, but you inside your interior, you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone not alone -- I'm not alone.
When I became a model model, I felt that I had ever achieved sleep that had had since a child.
My outside of the outside finally I would have my inner truth with my inner me.
For example, what I'm going to talk about later, when I look at this picture I'm going to go and look at this picture and I think, and I got this photo <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I was just <unk>
We all get rid of our families, our religion, our society, our society, our society, even our bodies.
Some of them have the courage to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or the beliefs of the people who are around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, my friends, my agent -- I even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth of being born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, I was always wearing this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom, I wondered, "Why would you always take that t-shirt on <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair, I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I would never tell me to share my story, not because it thought to be what I'm bad, it's bad, but by how the world is those of us who want to do.
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> from the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in the Philippines in the Philippines in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> to me, and this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15, when I was old years old, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever participated in the <unk>
He said to me that if she <unk> she was <unk> from the <unk> and he <unk> and that night, he won in a bathroom suit.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of the <unk> of beauty.
Not a lot of people to say that their first work was a <unk> of the beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> about everything when we go to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that he passed my statement to the green card that could be going to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, like traveling and being a queen of <unk>
But two weeks later, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to.
My mom suggested me to put me two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities, the most sophisticated surgeries are doing the most sophisticated surgeries and secure surgery.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to get the surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their music document means that you can drive to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me that it was the license to live, to feel <unk> to me.
Suddenly my fears looked at <unk>
I felt that I could feel that I could take my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think this <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> his truth, and he was living in the fact that he was in the end of his life.
For a lot of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20th of November we do a global manager for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage for a long history of people that <unk> and he stood up to the injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk> and Sylvia <unk> and Sylvia is <unk>
Right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living living in my living and just for me.
I want to do the best for helping others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here -- I am here to have no longer <unk> than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Would you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you, thank you -- thank you  <unk>
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- thank you first, to thank you with all my <unk>
I was in my support to my parents, and my parents, in my family, in my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women -- I've been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that his parents couldn't take it, and he would call my mom and he was going to her mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, others don't. It's a <unk> of gender, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned an gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table on the table that sometimes not block it, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work so much to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that you all be my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, they are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education by their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> National <unk> of peace, made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the history of the <unk> of violence and the exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you were born, the birth of the birth of your birth you wouldn't be <unk>
It's not welcome to not by his father, and by his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives his <unk> to the mother and no one of the father.
And a mother got a lot to get a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother mother -- but the daughter <unk> the newborn daughter, when it goes on, it suffers as well.
At the age of age five years old, when I should go to school, he stays home to her siblings.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can be <unk>
You can play with your friends in the street, and you can play with your friends as a butterfly.
But when it comes to adolescence, when it comes to 13 years when I was to get out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor called his father and their siblings and their family, and if they were to put the code of that honor, of that honor, could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of honor code is not just affecting the lives of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of his sisters and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm more <unk> and it's called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very <unk> humble and very <unk>
It's <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and it accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and decisions to the <unk> even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it or if you put it with a old, the old man has to come, because you don't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If you were a very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, you <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, the <unk> <unk> of his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
I read brothers and sisters, when he was born, and she was born, and I don't really love it to be honest, and believe me, I don't really like our eyes, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, I felt extremely <unk>
And so before I went back, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated by a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so that he called my daughter so much.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I took my pen, and I wrote a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk> <unk>
And when she came up when she was four and a half years old, he <unk> in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a girl girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted you in Canada, in the United States, but in a lot of the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, in tribal societies.
<unk> in a school that means the recognition of their identity means of their name.
One stages to school means that it has into the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they were <unk> the <unk> and I was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit down with me when my friends friends come to me.
And encouraged them to go to with me at a different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to engage it in your personality.
And this wasn't just for it, just to <unk>
I was <unk> all these good values all of my school and boys in the way.
I used the education for the <unk>
I went to my daughters, taught students to forget the <unk>
He taught them to the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in the society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for the women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the women of women in all of the political and economic activities and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls and the singers singers to <unk>
<unk> millions, but just a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the 10 years, <unk> he raised and got up to the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, he was offered her same for the documentaries of New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the October of 2012, 2012, he was taken to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he was going to the ear of my wife, <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And he said, "Please do me not <unk>
<unk> the fair cause you <unk>
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of the <unk> because of the <unk> and your daughter inspired in you and your daughter inspired you to <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
So these few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't get back to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and I had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow of the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm fine with my <unk> smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give me okay. Please not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from it how to resist the most difficult moments and happy to share with you with you who are despite the rights of the children of the children and women -- it's like any three-year-old girl.
You know, when you don't have his task.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very excited about that.
People ask me, "What are special in my <unk> who have made so bold bold to <unk> so brave and expressive <unk>
I tell you, let me tell you what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> the brain is 18 years ago, and since that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined by the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you go to a brain operation when you get to a brain operation when you get to a brain surgery.
You're being just as smart or not?
Not to be like that, I'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, matter, but it was the dead part of the heart that creates important hormones and <unk>
After the operation, I had to have to decide what to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, you know, if you didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about the combinations and <unk> and to try and do it to follow life.
More than one time I have saved by <unk>
But luckily, I got soul from the <unk> so I decided to get the dose to trying to get the dose -- because there really isn't a clear map.
I started to try with a different <unk> and I was struck by looking at how small changes at the <unk> <unk> my sense of who was me, my way of thinking about, my way of who was me, my way to think about, my own way of who I think, is to think about thinking, my behavior with the others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried to <unk> there and typical chemicals for a man from <unk> and I was surprised to see what my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various kinds of things, or perhaps some versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation about the men and what they have to do it -- since then I got better with men.
What was going to do to be able to that <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to get my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> of my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think almost always in pictures, and that became my point point, which became my view, which I use those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thinking is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the brain works -- to me, is simple simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to the <unk> and <unk>
So, after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> but really <unk> <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take very quickly these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world to the world to <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, like the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty trying to do this is to simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to two recent experiments that we have done by two recent experiments that were done by two groups in neuroscience.
And so they both used to MRI an fMRI image and an fMRI image -- to represent the brain. And you can see the brain scan done by <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks a image.
The average column in the middle shows the brain of the brain of that same individual, while you were looking at that same image.
The one on the right is created by the <unk> of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagining the same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you with another experiment. This is the lab from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's go through this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos in YouTube while their brains are <unk> their brains to create a great plastic reaction to video sequences.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new animals, new animals, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain information is scanning it to show you what it seemed like the person I was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right near to do that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same picture, it is created in the brain the same <unk>
This is done with the brain scanning systems scan systems available to available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we achieve that?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is to open the skull and put electrodes.
I didn't offer me for that one.
So many of you are proposing of some of you are proposing of projection by images, even I, even with the recent result of the MRI first we need to ask the next question: this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way the conventional wisdom is to get bigger magnets, but at this point, magnets it just gives you small improvements in the resolution of the resolution of thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of magnets larger, make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different, like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI were to make really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in the <unk> of brilliant solutions and brilliant in encode and <unk> on the northwest, and often of FM radio <unk>
At the same time of a magnetic field, they are <unk> magnetic patterns -- at the frequencies of radio <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with patterns of processing patterns, we can increase a massive form of the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split up in layers our growing knowledge on the structure structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I've mentioned that and maybe even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We are able to make our ideas directly directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go on top of language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be compelling use as a tool to amplify our skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool that could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and the similar tool it could be like the <unk>
We have a few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it's going to take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you this night about coming out of the closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just from the gay issue.
I think we all have <unk>
Her approach may be telling you for a young time when you first love or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have in life.
And it is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived there and have lived out of that topic.
Doesn't fear, and it must happen.
So many years ago, I worked in the South Side -- I worked in the South Side -- I worked in the South Side of the city, and I was there, I had to go through my armpits, <unk> <unk> <unk> letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope that the <unk> of my pants breath, and for me to get my head a little bit, I would ask you, usually a child or a <unk>
And would it be uncomfortable silence.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother turned a cold <unk>
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> in the inside.
And I came to the point that every time he went to a place where there was a child in three and 10 years, were ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that next time I would say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks after a few weeks, it happened.
Are you a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time was to be <unk> and I was just about the female issues at the table.   I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then I took a breath and I went down and my back, a little girl in four years with a pink dress that is looking at me, and staring at it, and just a little girl with a question: "Are you a guy with a question: "Do you have a kid or <unk>
So I put it out on a very long one, and I put it out about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a <unk>
I have the short hair for a boy, and I saw clothes clothing -- but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
But I'm more of the kind of a girl in a pajamas.
And that little girl I looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was everything. And you just are a girl. You are a girl.
What about <unk> they <unk>
It was the most difficult conversation we ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the child of the <unk> and I, we were both <unk> and I was <unk>
So as a lot of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and often my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
And I will give you 100 reasons for why to go out from my family, it was harder than it comes out of the <unk> It's hard not to <unk>
<unk> it's hard.
Who can tell me that explain to someone who have declared to be <unk> more difficult than to tell him that he has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell the story more difficult than to tell your child from five years that you're going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, only this hard.
We need to let us recover what is difficult to do for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our blueprint, and we must only feel empathy because we all live in something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may make them feel security, or at least more security than you have the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls, your walls, you are not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago. Thank you.
I, I had a horse <unk> a <unk>
It was not the <unk> lesbian that was ready to fight any four years that I would get to coffee.
I was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk> and moving only one muscle -- is that ever ever done.
My family, my whole whole friends, who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was on my wedding wedding wedding.
It was the first time that many guests were invited to know that it was gay, and as my black <unk> and he walked around the tables and finally I went around the tables and then I came to one where the friends of my parents, I who knew I was doing years ago.
And after I'm going to talk about a moment, one of the women I picked up to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Did you have ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked to having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite television show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace Will Grace and Grace
And you know who are <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but expected to desperately show her support, to get me out of my hand, and finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using my husband using it <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find out that they were <unk>
And what else can you do to somebody, you know, <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
It's like the hard conversations that still continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three early principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any work is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
You can get on your armor.
That little girl in coffee had no salt, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others have to know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that you're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe could be gay, they will hold the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important three, and more important.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be <unk> for that.
And some of you can go out safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark being, you find a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If we look at the history of how this intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> of which "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the <unk> question if a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this stuff as a <unk> the <unk> of computing to the <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know anything about Earth or neuroscience is no intelligence on Earth, but have incredible telescopes of the Earth, but have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth for the Earth, and you have incredibly lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, like <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a marine race that knows nothing about this, that doesn't have any concept on Earth, you would see that forced to actually develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time at time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet, you stop it.
And so I claim that this is the same question of understanding the physical nature of the physical nature of the intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism underlying intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be similar to the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that make the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the training of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the future of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, do it for several years ago: -- there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a <unk> claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in the end of maximize the future of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open options, with the diversity of the <unk> with the diversity of the future of the future of possible future.
In a words, the intelligence doesn't like it to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so you have to realize this equation, is natural natural to ask: What can do with this?
How <unk> it?
You know, the level of human intelligence level.
<unk> the intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video now, I'm going to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested to make universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long-term entropy of any system in any system that can find out to maximize the production of entropy in the long term.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal testing, play games, playing human games, and even winning money, and even winning money, and even make any money to it.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just as a <unk> human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to just her balance <unk>
This skill skill will have applications for humanoid robotic robotics and human technologies.
This capacity for intelligent tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, as a few other animals can cooperate to just just just like some other animals in the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has some interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, we see successfully played a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> together new connections to a social network where the friends are constantly constantly and keeps them with success to the social network.
This is the same ability of the network of the network also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, <unk> discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to the world in the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it is widely applicable in the problems of and the logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> series of <unk>
This risk management skill will have massive applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking, upright and social cooperation all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future and their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> robot, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> was always the concept that if we were smart machines, smart machines.
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all had the concept of <unk> <unk>
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and we try to take over the world.
It's all the contrary, that the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come out directly to the control, instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the goal.
You often ask me, how do you do me, how do you look for goals like this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants of order to help them build artificial artificial or to help them understand human intelligence is this: The intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've <unk> our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, around other stars, which points to Earth is just one between the billions of the planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures faint intensity by stars when the planets are moving around in front of them, and through a little bit of that light that will come to us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance and their mother.
And together, this helps us to understand that all these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light you get from your <unk>
And again, this is clues about whether these planets that we find these are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of <unk> worlds that potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year, the hottest of the <unk>
<unk> ice and sea ice has been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter in decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to the global scale have over quickly our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a scientist of weather, and I am not <unk> and <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the workplace.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look like the similar planets look like the Earth, more enjoy our own own own.
Each one of these new worlds to a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, shown this by a mission that we <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and that's why we study that we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> trace its surface in pursuit of clues about the origins of life, and as we know it.
The satellites as the <unk> mission -- they take samples from the atmosphere <unk> and try to understand how Mars has been able to understand how Mars has been able to <unk>
Business private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the driest places, much of the air on Earth, air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical gas forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement by Mars and the other planets will come to me with a big and sad wisdom and belief and belief and belief that the belief that Mars will expect that to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly <unk> the Earth.
And so I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep exploration with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars Mars is going to be there to convince humanity is to be there to humanity is as I think the captain of the Titanic of Titanic to get to the <unk> party --  Thank you.  Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and cognitive preservation are not <unk>
No, they are actually faces faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve and improve life better.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Just come home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces in the hostile spaces, in the hostile spaces -- maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment with the <unk> <unk>
So many years years ago, the Enrico Enrico Fermi I asked them to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found some evidence of alien life in this universe.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider it to consider to keep living among the stars, they lose the notion of the important of the importance of the origin of the origin of the origin of our development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we will save ourselves from themselves, but the planetary <unk> and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our capacity to the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would get my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and all were very <unk>
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it off.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff at night to go through the next morning, and my <unk> from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, <unk> <unk>
I'm a profession and I know a profession about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rate goes down and <unk> levels of adrenaline and thinking.
And when I came to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do bad systems that could put bad things out there.
Or at least if there are bad things going on bad things, that <unk> the likelihood that it's a catastrophe a total <unk>
So I started to think about that, but even a month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about my <unk> and he had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing with me that he had been practicing with something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about a years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts coming and find out to find out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then try to figure out how to figure out what can do to avoid what it can do to prevent the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, it <unk> a place for things that they lose easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of important things, where the fine, where the fish are, the dead trees -- where the trees are living and <unk> and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find your nuts.
And if you ask yourself if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and you could still find your nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that are moving so much.
This is the reason for losing your car and read your reading and read your reading and <unk>
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook up with the door, maybe the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For their <unk> a particular drawer do.
For their reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and you are <unk> with it all your stuff that's always going to be there.
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone a picture of your credit card driver's license to drive, which they're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, your brain releases yourself.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on it.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all in that situation, we will have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care, or to be dear to helping them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision decisions, and in fact, for the decision to make financial decisions and social decisions and all kinds of decision you need to take a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol outcome is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease to the heart attack.
So you are thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol -- then your doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that you will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there is a question that should be done then, one statistic to ask for what most physicians don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to engage surgery in any of any medical procedure before they can help into a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't get me wrong, something if not to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's fault to somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs is only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely -- more <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help an person?
300.
This is according to the research of the researchers who <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> in an independent form of <unk>
I think the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they stop a heart attack, brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might say, "Well, one chance on 300 to my <unk>
Why don't it <unk> <unk> the recipe of all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, you know, <unk> <unk> Right?
For this particular medicine, the side effects produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, "The five percent is not too likely to go to me, I will be going to be going to be going to my own <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that low stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning.
300 people take the drug, right? One person has <unk> five percent of them have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out with the drug that help you to help your medicine.
I don't say that you should or don't make the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is it part of the principle of informed informed consent of it informed
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the air value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to deal with it's quite typical.
For the surgery that you get in the most of the most <unk> men in the prostate men, the number you need to treat cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for one person that she has <unk>
And side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions before you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of a choice for a lot of times, you want a shorter life, you want to have a long life to have a lot of pain into the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, their family and their loved ones.
They can change from the heat of the moment, but at least one is trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment -- a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face <unk> with a predator, is not necessary to the <unk> system or <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism into those things, not very quickly -- you could have to be the lunch of the lions, so nothing of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window of stress during those moments of stress thinking, is the logical thought, like Danny <unk> and your colleagues have shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future, how could that be those <unk> to put the systems into the place that will help minimize the damage or to prevent the bad things to the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I installed a combination of combination with the door, with the door, with a key to the gate that you remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I have no longer <unk> and lots of mail that I've not seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite favorite symbol <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing tree, the <unk> tree -- you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language of French came over the decade in 1800, and with the end of the time, it mixed with local signs, and the language that we developed as a <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But I now realize that it's not true that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like me living in a foreign country -- following their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> behaviors and norms.
So how do you understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the sound.
It <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I learned that I can create the sounds, and I've seen the <unk>
So I've learned, for example, ...
"Not <unk> the <unk>
"Don't make a lot of noise from the <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> the covered in the <unk>
This is what I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label of what the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
They were <unk>
Let's go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines have already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do this with my thumb is not really natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic board there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the tendency and that it was called me and called me the <unk>
There was no visual art. It was all hearing.
Now sound has gone into my territory of art.
Is it going to <unk> more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not only do you experience through your ears.
I can feel it way: I can feel it way: I can feel it visually, or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound sound and <unk> in my performance practice.
And everything that had taught me how to sound, I decided to let me go and <unk>
I started to create a new body work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, and the power of power, the social currency <unk>
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it might be so powerful to me and my artistic work, or I might be able to <unk>
I chose to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, your eyes of society is like not had a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as to be in my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with a lot of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value, like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If we don't continue this practice, I feel that I might be able to <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound as my new <unk> <unk> in the world of the music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note is can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said to a concept in <unk>
The two are very space very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals that can affect all the meaning of the signals.
I'd like to share with you with the piano the piano, so that you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> you divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you stimulate a parameter different for every finger while the piano, as your body expression, as your body expression, as your body expression, the shape of your body, the speed, the English language, the English language, as a linear language, just a <unk>
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers of <unk> fingers to express a concept of clear or idea.
If only a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with the music and volume. <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, we can make different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal.
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I see the <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign to a sign of visual and again, it could get to be like a visual piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is the day."
If you get it, and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing you can say that you can say <unk>
"All I know?"
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has got more <unk> than the other two.
So this represents the time to express the time in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is a hands, and the present is two hands, the present is in front of the body and the future is in the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and at the same time, <unk> it goes over again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think we automatically think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Can it me?
All of the hands in high school.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as a <unk> something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and things and signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one, please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, a third. Please stop it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's incredible looking at how the <unk> is alive and <unk> in the same as the music.
However, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have a sound, it automatically has social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that they don't have to be deaf to to learn <unk> I don't have to hear the music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of the same experience.
I'd like to be able to open up your ears, open your eyes, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that I'm me.
And as a child, my parents would tell me, "You can tell you everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these beautiful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or a ignorance of ignorance or a ignorance of ignorance or a ignorance of ignorance to to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I first found me older, I learned that adults too, and they're not very good at cleaning up to clean the other people.
The country, I'm now an adult and I teach civil citizens and invention at school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk on the beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, there are the beaches, it's not drinking alcohol, and not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And over the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we can gather those bits of plastic to the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's very expensive to use those enormous boats
So along with my students, with six to six years old, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> of work with <unk> <unk> so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools are feel nice and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I'll leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to get on something that we hope it will work.
We decide that instead of collecting bits of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> children are very excited about the robots.
Then we create quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we will transform light light and chambers and <unk> in a floating robot that will move slowly down the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic all floating through the sensor while the computer board is going to process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of how much plastic plastic in the water.
So let's take this step back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would get it even more.
The cool thing in this project is that the students saw a local and the local and <unk> are trying to solve immediately.
<unk> research on my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very well kids who are very well.
You see the news, you'll see the Internet, and you see it with this <unk>
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, cleaning the hands of the oil -- just using the hands, just using the hands in <unk> the world's <unk>
They were very surprised because this is the water that drinking water is the water that <unk> the water where the water is where you live.
You can also see that water is brown, the water is brown, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We build a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all sorts of substances that produce different spectra which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, and to look at a local problem, my students used to use their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in the way to other children.
<unk> research on a problem <unk> I saw myself forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe close to a more difficult problem, as close to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started by a giant waves of giant calls called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power <unk>
And today, according to the reports on the average tons of 300 tons still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific plant.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west Coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the coast of the <unk> coast and most people, and so many of the time, it's kind of safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching research with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> parents don't <unk>
But every night we reported the center of <unk> here is <unk>
It might seem that they didn't have the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all his life.
Along with them to discuss the <unk> data, and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do that, we created a map <unk> <unk> from the region around the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to representing data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And we could see that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the mountain system and <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the nearest nuclear power to the date.
We can get up to a mile from the nuclear central, and with the fishermen of the area in the sea floor of a <unk> we were collecting <unk> and we invented and built and built into the sea floor of a <unk>
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote global problem.
And it's been very exciting and to work very exciting in these different scales technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so small in Hong Kong we find an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and the <unk>
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry, chemistry, a little chemistry, can basically build it almost all there.
It's a place where adults and children can play play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become a reality with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asking us things like, we can invent the future of mobility <unk>
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the oil and the <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are the <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators, creators -- we need to prepare for the next generation to worry about the environment and the people, and so that I can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two of the radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel from steel, the other of a <unk>
One is synthetic the other organic one.
One is the environment about the environment, the other I thought it would be.
One is designed by nature, the other one is designed by nature.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool for <unk>
But living things alive are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information that it takes for every cell to work and to work for it.
The tools also have the consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production and mass.
The assembly lines have dictated by a world made in which a world made -- a world made -- the imagination of designers and trained architects to think their objects like <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material <unk> in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial navigation pores are thin <unk>
And the synthetic elephants in the back are <unk>
One acts mainly like filter, the other mainly as a <unk> and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually its functionality through variation by variation in the variation.
Here's a divided screen, which represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of every designer and an architect of every designer of every designer and gene, between the machine and the gene, between the Ford and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, and it shows you in the two screens with the left and the right, and it shows up in the two screens after me.
My work, in the simplest level, it tries to bring these two these two visions to bring out of these two visions and moving from the assembly and going to growth.
You probably ask yourselves why right now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years ago or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a very rare moment, where we were four disciplines that offer designers to access the tools that we had never had access to tools that we had never had access to the tools we never had before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, products and tools and tools through the speed of scales, in a scale of the <unk> which someday is not very distant to print buildings and graphics buildings to the nanoscale made out of the genetically engineered buildings made by the <unk> made of <unk> that <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype -- an archetype of the former Arab architecture -- and it has created a screen where the light is only to shape the shape of the light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a <unk> of Paris of Paris with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin of a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D <unk> 3D <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> this layer and <unk> in the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines and <unk> and soft and soft and soft and <unk>
This is the resolution of human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution and the instruments instruments, allowing us to design that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> <unk> becomes <unk>
We were <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, and color, and <unk>
Your surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to other material or another <unk> but we would continually <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious religious religious, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to really <unk> and got to define a lot of what I care.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sent to the Earth will grow a <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, before, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made it grow to the trees and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The land created a world made from the place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design if the objects were made from a single passion.
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material the kind of material material of the tree with fruit tree, and we found it.
The most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of produce each year by organisms as a shrimp, or or <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune their properties, we could generate structures by a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it the legal <unk>  We asked them a lot of <unk> extract -- the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we could achieve a wide range of properties, from <unk> hard and <unk> to the light, soft <unk>
To print the <unk> structures to actually print a system with multiple <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary by the properties of the material of the march and create these structures made of a single three of three three feet long, 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are ready, the <unk> leaves the dry side, to find a natural way to the air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard about yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT and MIT, the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition problems, and if it broadens even more, it has even more, windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have a structure made of shrimp shrimp in a architecture that acts as a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> <unk> in the sea, and <unk> life on the ground, <unk> and put on the ground, to grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate bacteria and control their flow.
So the <unk> <unk> we made our own elements of elements of new elements of life created <unk> made by <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just as opposed to <unk> metals -- so that instead of air metals -- new biological variables, new biological channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops. Are we <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, it <unk> two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and all the fresh water.
And the second E. E. bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One becomes light into sugar, the other blood sugar -- and it produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but by evolution by the design.
In order to contain these relationships, we created a unique channel that it looks like <unk> tract -- which will help flow these bacteria and make their way their way to their way.
So we started to grow those channels into the human body, <unk> the properties of material material.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it <unk> more transparent.
So this <unk> system is <unk> 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football camp -- and 10 times the very small gut intestine that our very gut intestine
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We very <unk> <unk> <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk> matter.
And if we could create any personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, including the damage tissue and <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
Now you know that a 3D printer is known to a 3D printer in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of the combination of two <unk> but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or <unk> linking those fibers in the between each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm was turned into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are written in a single material.
And in order to the end of understanding better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm worm <unk>
We put it into a box in a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch in a flat patch that we realized that you would have a flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that form, the composition, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape <unk> and <unk> a single <unk>
We were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> of silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that the silk silk worms, <unk> and <unk> that we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, the silk worms of silk on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We were <unk> worms of silk worms in a line.
And after it comes to four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as the <unk> <unk> they were <unk> they get <unk> and life starts again -- it starts <unk>
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
When we <unk> biological silk about the <unk> silk, they give it all this pavilion on its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms, <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to bring life into the products and the buildings around us, to form the ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two different visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired nature of nature to an nature that demands us, for the first time, which demands us for the first time, for the first time.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you to say, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they asked them for the first time we asked this?
They can <unk> with the fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Three.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused some type of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and he started websites, by the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And in general generally I like to try and persist in every rate, for having spent a long time spending a lot of time and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling is not a challenge, is to get it into <unk>
And I have to let it up.
But I got to get me on something else, something totally different, and I'm going to get myself to absorb and feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then I have found <unk> and then this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me to a lot of anxiety, so a lot of anxiety, for a lot of anxiety, for a lot of <unk>
The first one was because I wasn't sure how to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions to <unk>
Another reason why it caused me to so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was concerned to have fear of engagement, or being worried about it, or to be <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like me to ask me then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to doing things.
I'm going to tell you where you are, what you learned from the culture.
We ask first of us, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you're going to do.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers on kids like, like, <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question we do over and over again as we grow to a different and again, as we grow to a high school students are asked to be asked to pick them up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you before the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream that they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they could be.
In fact, it does just the contrary, because when someone asks you to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even if you do good ones, you might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You've got to be <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> and a creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to be doing for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that framework.
And you can feel it alone.
You may feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> <unk>
Could it help if you divide up in three parts: and a potential and <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms you can use the same idea, and you can also use other <unk>
During the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> it was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> it's about us as <unk>
You have any term that you like or your <unk> you want you or your own.
It seems like a kind of to adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe and he must be <unk>
But what I've learned to talk to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
There are three superpowers there are <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something again in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> their interests for the shared interests of data, visualization with data, and a design of the math and the design of the <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired by <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came with this unique idea this only by his <unk> <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
From the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background can be able to get a lot of these data points.
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we become interested in something, we are going to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have fewer fear of trying to try and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we have all learned to each new area that we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time and full-time writer and independent.
As a little pianist girl, he was an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer before I was <unk> it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability to write the compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's a waste of time to go to what you might be able to even if at the end of the end, it will <unk>
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, so you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. It is to say, the ability to turn it into a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the other of the videos of any other designer -- other designer designer -- sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk> and, sometimes, Mr. <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
And he is even more valuable because it can take over the needs of their clients.
<unk> Company Company Magazine Company as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and the organizations that can be able to meet the market needs the market needs to be able to <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if you're a funding to reduce your goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to encourage you to <unk> themselves.
We have complex problems, we have complex problems, right now, and we need creative thinkers to do in front of them.
Let's say they are, in their heart, specialists.
<unk> the belly of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams of a specialist in a specialist and a <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put on ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge of the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should be design and race lives that we are all connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a lot of them to be told to simply be more like their teammates <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you can take out of this talk, I hope that it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you put all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I tell you, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep his curiosity for curiosity for <unk>
Tell the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk> us.
Thank you.
In the year I was a woman named <unk> he took it to a psychiatric psychiatric
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help them, but it was to put it up until she said, unfortunately, it died in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy that never seen before.
But even more amazing, even more amazing things.
If I had been living alive today, we could not give it to her more aid than the fact that they were <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has gotten a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the infections, lots of treatments for HIV and <unk> for HIV, for a lot of more.
But it has been made in treatment for Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a team of scientists that work for more than a decade.
So I think this all the time.
Cancer is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect about 150 million that by the way, including many of you to have a lot of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease is almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you are going to spend your years with Alzheimer's or helping to care about a friend or being dear to Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., it's only about 200 billion dollars every year. million dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care spend for Alzheimer's.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs in the rise of five times in the year by 2050, the boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one who can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other than other diseases because we've invested less and money in the investigation of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in the cancer research than cancer in spite of the fact that it costs more than Alzheimer's and cause number year of deaths as cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but all the <unk> world -- disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, even scientists, scientists, Alzheimer's disease, with aging.
We thought it will be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable of aging.
But there is only a picture of a healthy healthy brain brain in comparison with a cancer patient, to see the real physical harm to this disease.
In addition to raising a severe of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy is always being deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's was found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
Over a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds and <unk>
There are places on the paper that they're <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots on the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left in the outside.
So this makes the protein molecules get <unk> to each other, forming groups who can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years in Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and <unk> of what step a bomb.
It would be a wire cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
So you have to find the right step out of it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently in its most part of the cords that have reduced wires and waited for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, we doctors, biologists, including engineers, physical, engineers. And engineers and anxiety.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of <unk> drugs that are specifically about this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one was out of our lab yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened when these drugs were in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick to each other within them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs these worms at an early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but the research like this shows that disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so to grow that hope, of overcoming the Alzheimer's, the Alzheimer's, we need the help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to <unk> that disease is a disease and that if we can do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have been more research and <unk> pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, drug scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move to HIV in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often cannot speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and the <unk> are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not -- most of the genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
We were talking about them and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I read this article in the <unk> column called the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience when we test the test of it at the last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers excited to get 36 to 36 and even more and then they both look at the eyes and they look at the eyes and they look at the eyes of the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or a ability, what would be?
Number <unk> When it was the last time you get another person?
And <unk>
We are <unk> these are more and more personal ones.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me <unk> to your mate -- what you like to her, I know you know, is very <unk> this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really struck me -- the gadget of the participants had been married to me -- the gadget of two had had been married six months later and invited to the whole lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance of testing this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so send me to the <unk> column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I suppose some of you probably wonder, you guys are going to still be asked, still still will still be done?
And the reason I think this is why I think this question is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before the article was <unk> was very nervous.
I had been working in an romantic book in the last few years, so I had been excited to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog can get a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and I imagined that my article in the New York Times was probably a few thousands of views.
And that's a good burden of attention on a relatively new relationship.
But as it happened, I had no idea.
The article was printed on Friday on Friday and the night, this happened in the traffic from my blog.
And the Sunday, they had been called me and he Show me and Good <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is encourage you to write a lot about being writing with a lot of cognitive experiences, but something else is to discover that life loving life of a has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your <unk>
And when people were called the <unk> or the people who did every day they are doing the same question: they still keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and they of strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman agreed to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it out there.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people comfortable feeling about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 of 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was an article <unk> by St. <unk> for San <unk> who included the study in these different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both did a public rise together.
I read television interviews and <unk> the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming a fear of becoming the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a range of which I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people I didn't want to know that if the work worked, they wanted to know if it was really being able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, real love, not just an adventure, love real, love.
But this was a question I didn't feel like to respond.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, and all the people made the wrong question.
How do you know it to do it together or not, and also <unk> and <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of the 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first of these questions at the same study in 1997. And there was the goal of researcher not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach between college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants became more felt more to do that with a number later after we do that, and they also used <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used to the police and the community and they have used to the people in the community of power <unk>
The original version of the story of the story, which tried to personal summer questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a <unk> <unk> college, and then a student came up to me and he said to me -- I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to tell you about the person with the person you <unk>
Well, he made a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, <unk> became better friends?
I know that I know they managed to get better to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that this was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for love.
I came across the study for the first time when I had 29 And he was going into a really difficult separation -- really hard.
I had that relationship since I had 20, what I was nearly an adult, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how to live without it.
So I was interested in science.
And I did everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that I could some kind of <unk> your heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I only did for the book I would write that in retrospect, it really seems really <unk>
I thought that if I built the knowledge of romantic love, I never have to feel so bad and just like I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than I went on.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for in times more than what I'm reasonably demanding to demand for me.
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to be <unk> on the one person to I I love I I love I I love.
It may be that the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 <unk> there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because they fall in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I believe that when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story version of the story that says, still keep together?
And their content with an answer of I know or No.
So more than a question, I would propose that ask more difficult questions like, how you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love with me when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live in the uncertainty of uncertainty that inevitably leads to a culture or even more, how do you live in your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good starting to have a more controversial conversation about what it means to love to someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I can apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and we're very <unk>
But they fall in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy thing.
So at the end of my psychic article -- love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love in love because we take the choice.
And I <unk> a little bit of the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was not considered anything that was supposed to be a choice.
I didn't think I had both to have that decision to make that decision, and how do you sometimes have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always choosing or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded there questions, you have chosen questions, and I would have chosen to love that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what we would do, and what maybe I will spend my life looking for it is that that myth is that that's true.
I want the very happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, and the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't wrote.
But what I have in change is the chance of choosing to love someone, and the hope that he would also love me, and it's funny, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> <unk> and in a way I came to a <unk> of the forest.
And the city of New York City a time.  One thing that really affected me but more more <unk>
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar box and a <unk> and a fork and a fork in a fork in Colorado.
And I thought that some of these strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's kind of <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> I was in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all of these things <unk> and I was making <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I did a kind of <unk> <unk> and Agnes Martin, the box and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it is <unk> to them, so I put more nuts on the canvas, I thought I could get <unk>
Instead, it occurred to the opposite. In a way it seemed like a size, it seemed to be <unk> like a <unk>
So I did I did I built more <unk>
This time, I started to add electronic elements -- strange bottles that I could find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for all of my life, and trying to figure out what all my life on my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can be able to flow like drawing <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals by <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can make an idea.
Then I did some little insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building the exhibits and those things, and I was making some of a money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form of the human form of human <unk> with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on the other window, and I had all these windows -- and it had all these windows together that fit into a three-dimensional composition of a three-dimensional composition -- and I had all these windows together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, so I call it <unk>
By the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Let's five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of it.
It's a little weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures are <unk> of animals between two worlds.
You're going from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here is where the creatures of the animals are headed to the <unk> lists for <unk> mass in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform, the <unk> <unk> the Boston of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, kind of also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand out of the hand.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth Earth and <unk>
So it's a <unk>
It's a story.
That's the hand you <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail.
Anyway, his tail does fire on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I went to that.
Things that go you know.
His tail ends up in an eye of <unk> made by terrorists by 1986.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were to baseball cards from terrorists.
Very <unk> at its time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or <unk>
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of the human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 or <unk> at groups.
They're like cells, they are <unk>
And you can walk between them. I is <unk>
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope, which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human <unk>
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can be <unk>
I'm going to come up with the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it does cover or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
This is a quick lift for these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills they come out and they go into this <unk>
There's a little scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
And within this box there is a physicist, there's a physical, a musician, a radio, a radio, a radio, a radio, a radio, which spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
We get the box and all the people in the inside of each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box in which it is living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, and these concepts of the countries, of the borders, the borders, of religion, not working.
We're all very facts about the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that pill is going to have the effect against pain, the <unk> and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any of any drug drug medication.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take anti-malarial drugs these serve to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and we will increase the source of cells.
But they are also known to their side effects on their <unk> side effects, because in time that it takes to get to the mainstream.
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes -- the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and not easily in the bloodstream.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big treatment problem with HIV with the current drugs treatment with the current drugs that are <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, <unk> to get the virus directly into the virus, without the risk of the virus, without the risk of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If they used to be used to care about wounds and surgery, they can be used for anything to do it <unk> including the transportation of the medication.
In fact, we are already using a laser pulses to open or cutting into extremely small holes, which opens up and close to the cells infected cells with HIV to introduce drug medication.
The best you say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little very powerful laser laser about the membrane cell on the membrane cell while these cells are embedded in a liquid that has the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug to absorb the drug into a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk>
We're now testing this technology in vitro or <unk> or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, it's a camera, it's going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it takes directly into the infection, while the laser is used to the site again to keep the blood cells.
Well, this doesn't look like a moment.
But one day, if you successful, this technology can lead to the control eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of the whole researcher in our case, in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups with armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk> insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the best of these violence and studying ways of violence and study ways to encourage the transition to violent participation to the <unk>
I work in the field I work in the world of politics and the <unk>
Understanding for these groups are key to solving all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-governmental actors.
For example, the <unk> deals with <unk> peace deals with 1975, and 2011, <unk> were signed in between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any design process of successful conflicts.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why you do it, how do you do it, but nobody analyzes what you do when you're not <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies of <unk> and <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> no global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1970s, it has also established a political game, a political game, a social system and a network of social services and a network of social services.
In the same way, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks.
So these groups are making more than simply fire.
They are multitasking people.
We were <unk> a complex machinery of communication stations and radio channels of the Internet and Internet channels and Internet websites and strategies on social networks.
And here is the <unk> magazine in English and published in English and <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex <unk> of funds, but by using business -- for example, in order for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to reduce their funds, to to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They run schools, they run hospitals, they put hospitals, put into professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer something that the state groups are trying to something that the state is not <unk> and protection.
The world's ascent of the Taliban in a European Afghanistan -- or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to <unk> the efforts of these groups by giving them safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But in general, providing social services -- it means filling a vacuum <unk> a <unk> <unk> and it enables these groups to strengthen their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 by <unk> of <unk> can't be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we looked at groups -- we just thought about the <unk>
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, groups or strategy in the long term.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up with <unk> gaps by government, and emerge as armed and political groups are involved in violent struggle and give the governance.
And the more complex and more complex organizations, are these organizations, fewer and less like a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, they run from a territory, and they run the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's another thing, new and different.
And what's <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world in a world of states, and the <unk> and the most weak ones are states, like in the Middle East -- the more step and fill that gap black actors and <unk>
This is important to governments, because to counter to <unk> because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that governance of the government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important in order to establish and put in peace.
If we understand better at groups, we will understand better what incentives will offer to foster violence to the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not <unk> the military power can win a few <unk> but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that gap of security to fill that <unk> of the government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure of woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> label would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And so I got to tell me as a bad feminist feminist.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then the interviews people started to call me <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what it started as a personal joke to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, all over my youth and the age of 20 years, there was strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and hated sex. As if that was bad.
Today, I see how these women are treated in the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in the <unk> who might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> and a taboo and a nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with the high self-esteem and to believe that it's just like a <unk>
No one wants to be that <unk> woman, until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
With time, as I went growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and so proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same good at the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like it <unk> free of harassment or violence.
We have a right to use that easy way and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When we talk about the needs of women, we need to have on our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, and we are a different expression of gender, religion and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
We have to have to have these differences and how do we behave in the same way that matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. It's a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I hear rap music to all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and <unk> me deeply, the classic the classic <unk> of the Yin yang -- <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually go with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical thinking.
I firmly believe I firmly believe that this is the whole thing I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> but also killing insects -- the garbage collection and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink <unk>
<unk> of the fashion magazines and the things right.
I can see the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> from the <unk> fairy tales, who are <unk> actually.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, they would make that choice, as well.
The problem is not that economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable to the <unk>
We have this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that the conventional Feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women in color, the gay and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> women for <unk> <unk> and <unk> in middle class.
<unk> if that's good feminism a very bad feminist Revolution.
It also happens to the following: As a neuroscientist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be <unk>
When we get <unk> we take it with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I was <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, and they are afraid of the sector, they are afraid of being <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag means for not being able to be able to be able to do it with the <unk> <unk>
Take <unk> or like I call <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years is a feminist feminist <unk>
In the Video: Music <unk> Music of 2014, in front of the word <unk> from three feet height.
It was a <unk> show. It was looking at this star of pop embrace openly the feminism and making young men and young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began to <unk> if they <unk> it was or not precisely a feminist.
He <unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We have perfection perfection because we're still fighting for a lot, we need a lot, we need so <unk> so <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the sensible critical and <unk> of any woman, <unk> until I got nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, more or more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing their <unk>
These artists are not going to change their way to talking about women in their songs until <unk> change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify for a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify that it is more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to us and is our responsibility.
I believe in my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls who are <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
And they were going to be fascinated by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden the best option, as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is the sex violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when the movies not deal with women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports organizations, where they are going to make their partners a <unk>
In any case, the men, especially young white men -- heterosexual men who can say, "No, I'm not going to publish it in his project, to participate in their project, or work with you, until they even have a number enough women to participate in their own decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, and we can also teach ourselves to be even as more like us, to overcome the barriers to the way to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we are not groupers -- without these efforts, without adopting these efforts, without embracing our successes.
We can make these little things these little courage and hope that our decisions are going to the top of people and people in the community and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who make great decisions, more courageous, to create significant change.
We can also claim with the courage to make us -- good, bad, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because my voice -- my voice was a stolen and life helped me to me.
There was a incident.
I call it incident to do in front of what happened.
A few guys asked me when she was very young, he didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I would get my voice, and then after I didn't believe that I would say something that could matter.
But I was writing. I was writing.
And it came to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was not nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like them as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
And by writing and I also learned that if I was a little brave another woman could be <unk> another woman I could tell you, and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have the humbling reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I am a good woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think -- what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a little courageous, when you need to be a bit of <unk>
Right after the last year of last year, <unk> children in California had met <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the measles that may be terrible for a child to a child with a immune immune system, it's one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half the century -- but a lot of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the science of autism and the vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical
I don't think most of intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth estimates of autism growth in time.
Over the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about she believed to develop all his professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates of prevalence was just three or four or four kids -- for every 10 dollars.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> from <unk> of funds as they refer to autism as well as an epidemic as if she could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people of the Disease Control of the Disease Control of Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and A better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother that is looking for the face of his children's <unk>
If they had the criteria of diagnosis they had to be able to the beginning?
Why were the autism cases so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to be less to see the slow progress and <unk> of the science of science that we could be able to <unk>
During the most 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that history turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same story being <unk> and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins that describes an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed to <unk> worlds in the private patients -- the people around them, even to their own parents.
They could be fun for hours waving their hands in their face, but they were <unk> from <unk> as they were not putting their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By 1950, as the main authority of the world in the world, I declared that I'd seen less than 150 cases of his syndrome while <unk> of places as distant South Africa.
This is not really wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis is very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving kids that diagnosis to children but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had nine in 10 children were sent for the doctors for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, smart man, but part of his theories they weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child with cold parents and <unk>
And these kids, he said, carefully kept in a fridge in a fridge that you didn't exist.
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that engage them in certain areas like music, math and mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before it turned to the age of <unk>
When his mother put one of his favorite <unk> he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of the skills, saying things like the kids were simply <unk> what they heard their parents who had to get their parents to win their approval issue.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to the institutions for good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade in the 1970s that researchers started to test theory that autism theory was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers were <unk> it was quite stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a very autistic autistic daughter called <unk>
And John knew how hard it was hard to raise a girl as an black-eyed Susie!
To defend the National Service, I have the more resources for the autistic kids, and their families, and their colleague, Judith <unk> they decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
We have a prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population.
We had a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find the people to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse than the fact autism was so much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in his fascination with the astrophysics, of <unk>
In another way, these kids don't <unk> on beautiful frames and <unk> as a lot of them, so much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been rid of these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article that was published in German <unk> the next year to the article the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation in the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he talked German, and he was <unk> for her.
The document is an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> <unk> who was an integrated clinic in Vienna in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children of children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with exercises they started with exercises and kids followed their games on top of them by the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, described as disability from life that required to the life that needed <unk> forms of support and <unk> <unk>
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, were calling their little teachers, and he was forced to help in the development of the education methods that were particularly right to them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse variety that included an amazing variety of <unk> and <unk>
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture like the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk> and Professor <unk>
He was more than even to say, that for success and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when the autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis of what they call the diversity of what they called <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and the principles of the '90s, its changes in <unk> by the limited model -- the limited model of <unk> by a broad and decoration.
These changes did not fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world to be able to reform all over the world in the first time.
Before it came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just just a little circle, <unk> by experts -- I knew what the autism, but after <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> and psychologists, and teachers and parents around the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, they were introduced first clinical tests, use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in criteria and the introduction of these tests created a net effect, a perfect storm in the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was, so what it was, what the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services to be <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines by the increase in the <unk> and a simple simple, <unk> history, as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism theory, that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States is right in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people who have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding the <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC is working with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from a <unk> of attention deficit
And certainly the autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still achieving <unk> who believed that most of the most autistic aspects are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, and the parents parents and parents in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on in cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence shapes on the planet to address the challenges we face as a society.
We can't afford to afford to buy a brain.
Thank you.
